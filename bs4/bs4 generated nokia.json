D-Band enables much higher bandwidth than other microwave bands and will serve as an ultra-high-capacity extension for 5G backhaul and fronthaul in dense urban environments. The trial, which was conducted by Nokia utilizing Nokia Bell Labs technology, is investigating how higher frequencies beyond 100 GHz, can support the increased capacity requirements of mobile networks. \u00a0\u00a0\nThe proliferation of 5G networks has seen increasing demand for high-capacity, high-speed microwave backhaul to support evolving network requirements and growing traffic. This requires the use of higher frequency bands previously not used for this purpose. These bands can support large channel bandwidths and handle up to 50 times more traffic than microwave bands typically used for mobile network backhaul. D-Band is expected to be mostly used in dense urban environments, thanks to the small form factors of the products involved.\nThe trial used an integrated dual-transceiver using a 2 GHz channel bandwidth\u00a0operating over a distance of approximately 200 meters; this solution was developed by Nokia Bell Labs. \nGiuseppe Targia, Vice President, Microwave Radio Links at Nokia said: \u201cThis trial demonstrates how we are continuing to push the boundaries to deliver best-in-class connectivity as the demand for 5G services grows. The D-Band will be important in delivering high-capacity 5G connectivity in the future. We continue to drive important innovations that support our customers with coverage and capacity where it is needed.\u201d\nResources\nMicrowave Anyhaul\nAbout NokiaAt Nokia, we create technology that helps the world act together.\nAs a trusted partner for critical networks, we are committed to innovation and technology leadership across mobile, fixed and cloud networks.

Over the last weeks we have suspended deliveries, stopped new business and are moving our limited R&D activities out of Russia. We can now announce we will exit the Russian market. During this process our priority continues to be the safety and wellbeing of our employees. \nFor humanitarian reasons, Western governments have expressed concerns about the risk of critical telecommunication network infrastructure in Russia failing. They have also emphasized the importance of ensuring the continued flow of information and access to the internet which provides outside perspectives to the Russian people.\u00a0Therefore, as we exit we will aim to provide the necessary support to maintain the networks and are applying for the relevant licenses to enable this support in compliance with current sanctions.\nThis is the most responsible course of action for Nokia to take as we exit the Russian market. \nRegarding the financial impact of the decision, Russia accounted for less than 2% of our net sales in 2021.

The trial took place at Hrvatski Telekom\u2019s laboratory in Rijeka, Croatia and was the first in the country to use 25G PON technology, and one of first trials with a DTAG company. \nSandy Motley, President, Fixed Networks at Nokia, said: \u201cAs fiber access networks develop, Communications Service Providers are now looking beyond the immediate needs of residential customers at new applications for enterprise customers and to support their own mobile networks with backhaul. 25G PON, which is available today with our Quillion powered fiber nodes, is an easy solution to immediately add scale and capacity and only requires a change in optics for operation.\u201d\nBoris Drilo, CTO at Hrvatski Telekom, said: \u201cThis demo shows that our FTTH network is fully compliant with the cutting-edge PON technology that will radically increase the capacity, bandwidth and quality of our broadband service in the future. By already deploying Nokia\u2019s single multipurpose G\/XGS-\/25G PON platform, we are showing exciting capabilities of the largest fiber network in Croatia capable of the fastest possible speeds.\u201d\nNotes to editors \nNokia\u2019s 25G PON solution utilizes the world\u2019s first implementation of 25G PON technology and includes Lightspan and ISAM access nodes, Quillion based Multi-PON line cards and fiber modems.\nDependent on the optics chosen, 25G PON supports symmetrical bitrates (25Gb\/s in downstream and 25G in upstream) and asymmetrical bitrates (25\/10).\nUsually located in telecom central offices, Nokia\u2019s high-capacity access nodes are deployed for massive scale fiber roll-outs. They connect thousands of users via optical fibre, aggregate their broadband traffic and send it deeper in the network. The fiber access nodes can support multiple fiber technologies including GPON, XGS-PON, 25G PON and Point-to-Point Ethernet to deliver a wide range of services with the best fit technology.\nNokia ONT (Optical Network Termination) devices, or fiber modems, are located at the user location. They terminate the optical fibre connection and delivers broadband services within the user premises or cell sites.\nFurther reading\nWeb page: \nNext generation PON\n\nRights-free multimedia: \n25G PON - the next step in Fiber Fixed Access (video)\n25G PON - the next step in Fiber Fixed Access (images)\nQuillion chipset and Lightspan access nodes (images)\n\nAbout Nokia\nAt Nokia, we create technology that helps the world act together.\nAs a trusted partner for critical networks, we are committed to innovation and technology leadership across mobile, fixed and cloud networks.

Adoption of the Annual Accounts\nThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting adopt the Annual Accounts.\n8. Resolution on the use of the profit shown on the balance sheet and authorization of the Board of Directors to decide on the distribution of dividend and assets from the invested unrestricted equity fund\nThe distributable funds on the balance sheet of the Company as at 31 December 2021 were EUR 17\u00a0282\u00a0854\u00a0713.47, of which the profit for the financial year 2021 was EUR 482\u00a0256\u00a0270.12.\nThe Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that based on the balance sheet to be adopted for the financial year ended on 31 December 2021, no dividend is distributed by a resolution of the Annual General Meeting. Instead, the Board proposes to be authorized to decide on the distribution of an aggregate maximum of EUR 0.08 per share as dividend and\/or as assets from the invested unrestricted equity fund. \nThe authorization will be used to distribute dividend and\/or equity repayment in four installments during the period of validity of the authorization unless the Board of Directors decides otherwise for a justified reason. The authorization would be valid until the opening of the next Annual General Meeting. The Board would make separate resolutions on the amount and timing of each distribution of the dividend and\/or equity repayment so that the preliminary record and payment dates for the dividend and\/or equity repayment will be as set out below. The Company shall make a separate announcement of each such Board resolution.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Preliminary record date\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n Preliminary payment date \n 3 May 2022 \n 12 May 2022 \n 26 July 2022 \n 4 August 2022 \n 25 October 2022 \n 3 November 2022 \n 7 February 2023 \n 16 February 2023 \nThe dividend and\/or equity repayment based on the resolution of the Board of Directors will be paid to a shareholder registered in the Company\u2019s shareholders\u2019 register maintained by Euroclear Finland Oy on the record date of the dividend and\/or equity repayment.\nBased on the total number of shares in the Company on the date of this proposal, the authorization would be equal to an approximate maximum of EUR 456 million. The proposed total authorization for dividend and\/or equity repayment is in line with the Company\u2019s dividend policy.\nSince the Board has proposed that instead of an immediate dividend resolution, the Board would be authorized by the Annual General Meeting to decide on the dividend and\/or equity repayment as set forth above, the shareholders have the right, in deviation from the Board\u2019s proposal, to demand a minority dividend, pursuant to Chapter 13 Section 7 of the Finnish Companies Act. The minority dividend must be distributed, if a demand to this effect is made by shareholders who have at least one tenth of all shares. The amount of minority dividend is EUR 241\u00a0128\u00a0135.06, which corresponds to half of the profit of the financial year. A shareholder demanding minority dividend may vote for the minority dividend in advance voting, and no separate demand or counterproposal is required. The Board has informed that it would take the potential distribution of minority dividend into account as a reduction in the amount of funds to be distributed based on the authorization, provided that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board to decide on the distribution of funds as proposed.\n9. Resolution on the discharge of the members of the Board of Directors and the President and CEO from liability for the financial year 2021\n10.

Other remuneration payable to the Board and Committee members would remain unchanged, including the annual fee of the Chair of the Board and the Company\u2019s practice according to which no additional annual fees are paid to the Chair of the Board for service in any of the Board Committees.\nConsequently, on the recommendation of the Board\u2019s Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee and in line with the Company\u2019s Remuneration Policy, the Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the annual fee payable to Board members for a term ending at the close of the next Annual General Meeting be as follows:\nEUR 440\u00a0000 for the Chair of the Board;\nEUR 195\u00a0000 for the Vice Chair of the Board; \nEUR 170\u00a0000 for each member of the Board;\nEUR 30\u00a0000 each for the Chairs of the Audit Committee and the Personnel Committee and EUR 20\u00a0000 for the Chair of the Technology Committee as an additional annual fee; and\nEUR 15\u00a0000 for each member of the Audit Committee and Personnel Committee and EUR 10\u00a0000 for each member of the Technology Committee as an additional annual fee.\nThe Board of Directors proposes that approximately 40 percent of the annual fee be paid in Nokia shares purchased from the market on behalf of the Board members or alternatively by using treasury shares held by the Company. The rest of the annual fee will be payable in cash to cover taxes arising from the remuneration. The directors shall retain until the end of their directorship such number of shares that corresponds to the number of Nokia shares they have received as Board remuneration during their first three years of service in the Board. \nIn addition, the Board proposes that the meeting fees for Board and Board Committee meetings payable to all the other Board members, except for the Chair of the Board, remain at current level. These meeting fees based on travel required between the Board member\u2019s home location and the location of a meeting would be paid for a maximum of seven meetings per term as follows:\nEUR 5\u00a0000 per meeting requiring intercontinental travel; and\nEUR 2\u00a0000 per meeting requiring continental travel.\nOnly one meeting fee would be payable in the usual case of multiple Board and Board Committee meetings per eligible travel. \nMoreover, it is proposed that members of the Board of Directors shall be compensated for travel and accommodation expenses as well as other costs directly related to Board and Board Committee work. The meeting fees, travel expenses and other expenses directly related to Board and Board Committee work will be paid in cash. \n12.

The repurchases under the authorization are proposed to be carried out by using funds in the unrestricted equity, as resolved by the Board of Directors, which means that the repurchases will reduce the distributable funds of the Company.\nThe price paid for the shares under the authorization shall be based on the market price of Nokia share on the securities markets on the date of the repurchase or a price otherwise formed in a competitive process. Shares may be repurchased to be cancelled, held to be reissued, transferred further or for other purposes resolved by the Board of Directors.

The wholesale business model can support deterministic end-to-end services across both traditional services and new segments such as mobile network slicing and backhaul, data center interconnect, wholesale transport for retail CSPs and business customers, smart power grids and residential broadband backhaul, who all bring their own requirements in speed, latency, availability and security.\nService providers need to be able to easily scale capacity and support a wide range of existing and emerging protocols, while delivering guaranteed service level performance and security over a shared network infrastructure. OTN uses a digital wrapper to encapsulate TDM and packet services, providing a robust and efficient transport protocol ensuring hard isolation between different users across a common infrastructure. This proven optical transport technology helps CSPs scale their networks with more capacity and new service options, while ensuring the ability to meet strict SLAs demanded by end users.\nJames Watt, Head of Optical Networks Division, Nokia, said: \u201cWe are excited to offer advanced capacity scaling and extended service offerings to our 250+ 1830 PSS-x customers, while also enabling new service capabilities across the entire CSP wholesale market.

DmMIMO allows devices to leverage signal propagation to multiple cells or antenna panels in a network when establishing a link, thereby turning noise into a useful signal and increasing the uplink throughput. The data transmission is pieced together from multiple antenna panels and cell sites through distributed baseband processing. The processing load between the cell site radio units and the central processing unit is split in a novel way, reducing the fronthaul capacity to cell sites and hence lowering the cost.\nNokia is collaborating with AT&T on the validation of DmMIMO and testing the proof-of-concept technology in the AT&T labs. Bell Labs\u2019s DmMIMO simulations have demonstrated increases in 5G uplink capacity between 60% and 90% compared to similarly configured systems with a single panel. While other techniques come at the expense of downlink capacity, DmMIMO would produce sizable increases in uplink capacity without sacrificing performance.\nAT&T Labs is providing expertise in validating new cutting-edge technologies in the lab and in the field. For example, AT&T Labs provided network deployment details for specific cities, which has been used for detailed ray-traced simulations to understand the benefits of DmMIMO in real-world scenarios. Bell Labs is also benefiting from AT&T Labs\u2019 5G Testbed facilities with rooftops and poles connected by dedicated fiber networks to server racks in a lab environment. This capability enables experimentation to validate and improve the technology, leading to more effective deployment of the DmMIMO technology in the future.\nNishant Batra, Chief Strategy and Technology Officer, Nokia, said: \u201cAddressing uplink speeds is becoming critical as consumers are increasingly becoming content creators as well as content consumers, video conferencing has become a cornerstone of the teleworking era, and many of the applications in the industrial internet of things require higher uplink speeds. When 5G-Advanced networks come online, we will see the network enhanced in multiple dimensions, expanding and extending its capabilities. Even today, with the focus on 5G mid-band spectrum rollouts in the U.S., there are opportunities for technologies like this that can maximize available resources. We feel distributed massive MIMO will be a critical element of networking in the 5G-Advanced era to help meet these demands with significant gains in uplink without a hit to downlink performance. Three decades ago, Bell Labs and AT&T invented MIMO, so it is only fitting that we continue this groundbreaking work together for the next generation of MIMO.\u201d\nAndre Fuetsch, Executive Vice President & CTO Network Services, AT&T, said: \u201cAT&T and Nokia have a long history of working together on new network technologies, and I welcome this strategic collaboration for the development of distributed massive MIMO technology. Newer applications in the 5G-Advanced timeframe, such as eXtended Reality (XR), are expected to be more demanding on the uplink compared to regular broadband traffic. Technologies such as distributed massive MIMO show potential to improve uplink capacity in the right scenarios. DmMIMO is also a technology that shows potential for the next generation of wireless networks. Therefore, this strategic technology collaboration with Nokia may help provide learnings with long-term benefits to both companies.\u201d\nIn addition to uplink improvements, the move to DmMIMO has the potential to alter the configuration of networks by facilitating deployments with smaller antenna arrays per site. This will lower weight, which in turn will result in smaller and lighter components as well as reduced power consumption.\u00a0In alternate configurations, DmMIMO can also be used to boost downlink capacity, granting operators incredible flexibility in how they deploy the technology.\nResources\nDistributed massive MIMO video\nDistributed massive MIMO webpage\nAbout Nokia\nAt Nokia, we create technology that helps the world act together.\nAs a trusted partner for critical networks, we are committed to innovation and technology leadership across mobile, fixed and cloud networks.

ARPA-E projects have the potential to radically improve U.S. economic prosperity, national security, and environmental wellbeing.\nThe announcement represents an extension of Nokia\u2019s broader efforts to accelerate digitalization to help the information and communication technology (ICT) industry reduce its environmental footprint and to support other industries in becoming more resource and material efficient.\nThe increasing rate of digitalization and automation is driving compute systems and 5G communication networks to grow at incredible rates. AI algorithms are needed to deliver the growing range of digital services but require even more power-hungry compute hardware. Accordingly, cooling energy requirements are projected to grow from the current average of 30-40% of total power consumption preventing wider deployment of these new services and compounding the climate crisis that faces our world. The goal of this Nokia Bell Labs research program is a dramatic reduction in compute cooling energy to 5% or less with the additional benefit of eliminating the need to consume precious water supplies.\nWith ARPA-E support, Nokia Bell Labs and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign along with associate partners, including Carrier Global Corporation, will work together to explore a highly efficient, resource-conserving thermal energy architecture that will simultaneously improve energy efficiency of high-power-compute-cooling and deliver high-quality thermal energy that can be used directly for heating and cooling applications. By pursuing a low-cost, low-energy two-phase cooling philosophy from chip to room scale, the proposed technology will rearchitect compute infrastructure to provide a valuable heat source in a way that is practical and cost-effective.\nPeter Vetter, President of Bell Labs Core Research, said: \u201cAt Bell Labs, we find the technology limits and push beyond them to tackle the hard challenges. Working with ARPA-E and our partners, we will look at how we can allow for sustainable growth. Our goal is to play a positive role in tackling climate change in the U.S. by reducing and re-using the energy flowing through the compute and communications hardware that delivers the digital services we all increasingly rely on. By using resources in a more efficient way, we will be able to increase our use of AI in our networks without requiring more energy than we use today.\u201d\nNokia has committed to decreasing its emissions by 50% between 2019 and 2030 across its value chain. The targets includes its own operations, products in use, logistics, and final assembly supplier factories. Bell Labs has a long history of projects focused on improving energy efficiency, including inventing the first practical silicon solar cell in 1954. With broad applications beyond data centers, the project with ARPA-E will allow Bell Labs to continue supporting the United States\u2019 technological lead and sustainability goals by developing and deploying advanced energy and ICT technologies. \nResources\nWebsite: U.S. Department of Energy Press Release\nWebsite: Open 2021\nAbout NokiaAt Nokia, we create technology that helps the world act together.\nAs a trusted partner for critical networks, we are committed to innovation and technology leadership across mobile, fixed and cloud networks.

New monetization systems that enable operators to deliver new services, like slicing, faster and at scale are a critical enabler of helping CSPs and enterprises realize faster returns on their network investments.\nBut the Nokia-commissioned global survey of 100 CSPs around the world found that only 11% of respondents have sufficient Business Support Systems (BSS) in place to meet the needs of 5G-enabled business models. BSS are a critical patchwork of business applications, which includes monetization tools, that help CSPs manage their operations and supply chains through functions, such as billing and charging, and for delivering a solid customer experience.\nAn overwhelming number of survey respondents, at 98%, indicated they would have to alter their BSS in the coming years in order to put proper, up-to-date monetization tools in place.\nThe survey also found that nearly 70% of CSPs are now considering deploying cloud-based monetization solutions. In addition, two-thirds of respondents indicated they believe that real-time charging is essential for 5G monetization, in part because of its ability to help CSPs respond quickly to customer demands.\nA cloud-native software architecture is key to achieving a 5G-ready monetization system, with many benefits that include limitless scalability, and an ideal platform for AI, analytics, and edge computing capabilities for ultra-low latency use cases.\nMore details on the research can be found here.\nJohn Abraham, Principal Analyst at Analysys Mason, said: \"Most Service Providers are ill-prepared to effectively engage and monetize emerging 5G-enabled use cases and need to urgently transform their BSS. With Service Providers looking to get that ROI on 5G, now is the time for them to invest in flexible monetization systems especially as 5G brings to the forefront the importance of real-time charging capabilities. Given Nokia\u2019s portfolio and expertise, they are well placed to support CSPs on this journey.\"\nHamdy Farid, Senior Vice President, Business Applications\u00a0at Nokia, said: \u201cTo unlock 5G revenues and move beyond the traditional data plan model, a major shift among CSPs is needed toward adaptable monetization systems that utilize cloud-native, scalable and flexible infrastructure and open APIs for easy integration and deployment; and I think this survey highlights the work still to be done.\u201d\nAdditional ResourcesNokia monetization website\nNokia Converged Charging website\nNokia Monetize the 5G economy brochure\nAbout Nokia\nAt Nokia, we create technology that helps the world act together.\nAs a trusted partner for critical networks, we are committed to innovation and technology leadership across mobile, fixed and cloud networks.

The Nokia solution will provide secure, reliable, high-performance internet access to the homes of 2400 students using Nokia Private 4.9G\/LTE Digital Automation Cloud (NDAC) operating in the CBRS\/On-Go GAA spectrum, and customer premises equipment (CPE) including Nokia FastMile 4G Gateways and WiFi Beacons.\nThe DPOL technology team will operate its new LTE network through the centrally secure Nokia DAC Cloud monitoring application.\u00a0DPOL will also provision LTE \/ Wi-Fi hotspots to students to be used with any standard laptop or tablet to access high-speed internet.\nThe Federal Communications Commission has reported nearly 17 million school children in the USA lack internet access at home, creating a nationwide \u2018homework gap\u2019 (Federal Communications Commission). This became even more pronounced during the pandemic as schools closed and distance learning became the new normal.\nPaoze Lee, Technology Systems Director of the Dos Palos-Oro Loma school district,  said: \u201cAs we put a plan in place for distance learning during the pandemic we found we could only provide coverage for approximately 50% of DPOL students via commercial wireless network providers.

Other remuneration payable to the Board members would remain unchanged. \nConsequently, on the recommendation of the Board\u2019s Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee, and in line with the Company\u2019s Remuneration Policy, the Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the annual fees payable for a term ending at the close of the next Annual General Meeting be as follows:\nEUR 440 000 for the Chair of the Board;\nEUR 195 000 for the Vice Chair of the Board; \nEUR 170 000 for each member of the Board;\nEUR 30 000 each for the Chairs of the Audit Committee and the Personnel Committee and EUR 20 000 for the Chair of the Technology Committee as an additional annual fee; and\nEUR 15 000 for each member of the Audit Committee and Personnel Committee and EUR 10 000 for each member of the Technology Committee as an additional annual fee.\n\nThe Board proposes that in line with the Company\u2019s Corporate Governance Guidelines, approximately 40% of the annual fee be paid in Nokia shares either purchased from the market on behalf of the Board members or alternatively delivered as treasury shares held by the Company as soon as practicable after the Annual General Meeting. The rest of the annual fee would be payable in cash to cover taxes arising from the remuneration. \nIn addition, the Board of Directors proposes that the meeting fees for Board and Board Committee meetings payable to all the other Board members, except for the Chair of the Board, remain at current level.

The meeting fees, travel expenses and other expenses would be paid in cash.\nAuditor election and remuneration\nSince 2019 the Board of Directors has proposed to the Annual General Meeting that the shareholders would elect the auditor for the financial year commencing next after the election. Therefore, on the recommendation of the Board\u2019s Audit Committee, the Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that Deloitte Oy be re-elected as the auditor of the Company for the financial year 2023.\nIt is also proposed that the elected auditor for the financial year 2023 be reimbursed based on the invoice of the auditor and in compliance with the purchase policy approved by the Audit Committee.\nAuthorization to the Board to issue shares and repurchase company\u2019s shares\nIn line with previous years, the Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorize the Board to resolve to issue in total a maximum of 550 million shares through issuance of shares or special rights entitling to shares under Chapter 10, Section 1 of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act in one or more issues during the effective period of the authorization. The Board may issue either new shares or treasury shares held by the Company.

The authorization may be used to develop the Company\u2019s capital structure, diversify the shareholder base, finance or carry out acquisitions or other arrangements, to settle the Company\u2019s equity-based incentive plans or for other purposes resolved by the Board. It is proposed that the authorization be effective until 4 October 2023 and terminate the authorization for issuance of shares and special rights entitling to shares resolved at the Annual General Meeting on 8 April 2021. \nAlso, in line with previous years, the Board proposes that the Board be authorized to resolve to repurchase a maximum of 550 million shares. The repurchases would reduce distributable funds of the Company. The shares may be repurchased otherwise than in proportion to the shares held by the shareholders (directed repurchase). Shares may be repurchased to be cancelled, held to be reissued, transferred further or for other purposes resolved by the Board. It is proposed that the authorization be effective until 4 October 2023 and terminate the authorization for repurchasing the Company\u2019s shares granted by the Annual General Meeting on 8 April 2021 to the extent that the Board has not previously resolved to repurchase shares based on such authorization.\n550 million shares correspond to less than 10 percent of the Company\u2019s total number of shares.

Full year net sales grew 3% y-o-y in constant currency.\nComparable operating margin of 14.2% (reported 11.5%) in Q4 declined 190bps y-o-y (reported +480bps) due to lower Q4 seasonality as expected. \nFull year comparable operating margin of 12.5% (reported 9.7%) expanded 300bps y-o-y (reported +570bps) but also benefited from approximately 150bps of one-offs. \nComparable diluted EPS of EUR 0.13 in Q4; reported diluted EPS of EUR 0.12.\nContinued strong free cash flow generation of EUR 0.4bn in Q4. Full year free cash flow of EUR 2.4bn.\nGuidance for 2022 net sales of EUR 22.6-23.8bn and a comparable operating margin in the range 11-13.5%.\nNew long-term targets to grow revenue faster than the market and a comparable operating margin of \u226514%. \nBoard proposes dividend authorization of EUR 0.08 per share. Share buyback program to be initiated to return EUR 600m over 2 years. \nThis is a summary of the Nokia Corporation financial report for Q4 and full year 2021 published today. Nokia only publishes a summary of its financial reports in stock exchange releases. The summary focuses on Nokia Group's financial information as well as on Nokia's outlook. The detailed, segment-level discussion will be available in the complete financial report hosted at www.nokia.com\/financials. A video interview summarizing the key points of our Q4 results will also be published on the website. Investors should not solely rely on summaries of Nokia's financial reports and should also review the complete report with tables.\nPEKKA LUNDMARK, PRESIDENT AND CEO, ON Q4 AND FULL YEAR 2021 RESULTS\n2021 was a strong year for Nokia driven by our growing technology leadership, robust demand and a faster than expected reset of our business. This enabled us to deliver 3% constant currency net sales growth and a comparable operating margin of 12.5%. Thanks to a solid Q4 capping off a strong 2021, we have created an excellent foundation as we begin to move into the next phase of our strategy to deliver growth and expand profitability. \nAll our business groups made significant progress this year to make us more competitive in all the markets in which we compete. Mobile Networks largely closed the gap to competition in 5G and improved its gross margin while continuing to step up R&D investments. Network Infrastructure extended its technology leadership with significant growth driven by Fixed Networks and Submarine Networks. Cloud and Network Services continued to rebalance its portfolio and saw encouraging growth in its key focus areas. Nokia Technologies made good progress expanding in areas such as automotive and consumer electronics. \nThe progress we have made with cash generation in the business has strengthened our balance sheet to the point we can look to reinstate shareholder distributions through both a dividend and share buyback program. \nNokia enters 2022 in a strong position with improved margins, faster than expected strategy execution and a high order backlog, although the global supply chain situation remains tight. We see opportunities in the 5G roll out and growing enterprise market. Accordingly, we expect 2022 to bring another year of sales growth and we are targeting a comparable operating margin of 11-13.5% in 2022. \nConsidering how quickly we have executed on our strategy, we are now introducing new long-term targets. We still expect to deliver progress in 2023 but we want to emphasize that is not the end of our ambition. Our long-term target is to grow faster than the market and to achieve a comparable operating margin of at least 14%. The pace of delivery will depend on both the market environment and decisions we may make on R&D investments to secure our long-term competitiveness and sustainable profitability. \nFinally, I want to thank our employees whose excellence, resilience and adaptability have been critical in delivering this performance in 2021. We recognise how valuable each person is to Nokia\u2019s performance and we will increase investment in our people through our renewed people strategy.\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\n  EUR million (except for EPS in EUR)  \n Q4'21 \n  Q4'20  \n  YoY change  \n Constant currency YoY change \n Q1\u2013Q4'21 \n  Q1\u2013Q4'20  \n  YoY change  \n Constant currency YoY change \n Reported results \n \u00a0 \n  \u00a0  \n  \u00a0  \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n  \u00a0  \n  \u00a0  \n \u00a0 \n  Net sales  \n 6 414 \n  6 553  \n  (2)%  \n (5)% \n 22 202 \n  21 852  \n  2%  \n 3% \n  Gross margin %  \n 39.5% \n  39.0%  \n  50bps  \n \u00a0 \n 39.8% \n  37.5%  \n  230bps  \n \u00a0 \n  Research and development expenses  \n (1 118) \n  (1 145)  \n  (2)%  \n \u00a0 \n (4 214) \n  (4 087)  \n  3%  \n \u00a0 \n  Selling, general and administrative expenses  \n (758) \n  (777)  \n  (2)%  \n \u00a0 \n (2 792) \n  (2 898)  \n  (4)%  \n \u00a0 \n  Operating profit  \n 740 \n  441  \n  68%  \n  \u00a0  \n 2 158 \n  885  \n  144%  \n  \u00a0  \n  Operating margin %  \n 11.5% \n  6.7%  \n  480bps  \n \u00a0 \n 9.7% \n  4.0%  \n  570bps  \n \u00a0 \n  Profit\/(loss) for the period  \n 680 \n  (2 696)  \n  \u00a0  \n \u00a0 \n 1 645 \n  (2 516)  \n  \u00a0  \n \u00a0 \n  EPS, diluted  \n 0.12 \n  (0.48)  \n  \u00a0  \n \u00a0 \n 0.29 \n  (0.45)  \n  \u00a0  \n \u00a0 \n  Net cash and current financial investments  \n 4 615 \n  2 485  \n  86%  \n  \u00a0  \n 4 615 \n  2 485  \n  86%  \n  \u00a0  \n Comparable results \n \u00a0 \n  \u00a0  \n  \u00a0  \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n  \u00a0  \n  \u00a0  \n \u00a0 \n  Net sales  \n 6 414 \n  6 554  \n  (2)%  \n (5)% \n 22 202 \n  21 854  \n  2%  \n 3% \n  Gross margin %  \n 40.1% \n  41.6%  \n  (150)bps  \n  \u00a0  \n 40.4% \n  38.9%  \n  150bps  \n \u00a0 \n  Research and development expenses  \n (1 092) \n  (1 010)  \n  8%  \n  \u00a0  \n (4 084) \n  (3 817)  \n  7%  \n \u00a0 \n  Selling, general and administrative expenses  \n (659) \n  (670)  \n  (2)%  \n  \u00a0  \n (2 379) \n  (2 489)  \n  (4)%  \n \u00a0 \n  Operating profit  \n 908 \n  1 056  \n  (14)%  \n  \u00a0  \n 2 775 \n  2 081  \n  33%  \n  \u00a0  \n  Operating margin %  \n 14.2% \n  16.1%  \n  (190)bps  \n  \u00a0  \n 12.5% \n  9.5%  \n  300bps  \n  \u00a0  \n  Profit for the period  \n 731 \n  784  \n  (7)%  \n \u00a0 \n 2 109 \n  1 437  \n  47%  \n \u00a0 \n  EPS, diluted  \n 0.13 \n  0.14  \n  (7)%  \n  \u00a0  \n 0.37 \n  0.25  \n  48%  \n  \u00a0  \n  ROIC1\n 20.1% \n  11.9%  \n  823bps  \n  \u00a0  \n 20.1% \n  11.9%  \n  823bps  \n  \u00a0  \n 1 Comparable ROIC = Comparable operating profit after tax, last four quarters \/ invested capital, average of last five quarters\u2019 ending balances.

If the resolution is approved the dividend would be paid in quarterly installments starting after the AGM. \nOur dividend policy is to target recurring, stable and over time growing ordinary dividend payments, taking into account the previous year\u2019s earnings as well as the company\u2019s financial position and business outlook.\nShare buyback program\nIn 2020 and 2021, Nokia has generated strong cash flow which has significantly improved the cash position of the company. To manage the company\u2019s capital structure, Nokia\u2019s Board of Directors is initiating a share buyback program under the current authorization from the AGM to repurchase shares, with purchases expected to begin in Q1. The program targets to return up to EUR 600m of cash to shareholders in tranches over a period of two years, subject to continued authorization from the AGM.\nOUTLOOK\n  \u00a0  \n  Full year 2022  \n  Net sales1\n  EUR 22.6 billion to EUR 23.8 billion  \n  Comparable operating margin2\n  11 to 13.5%  \n  Free cash flow2\n  25-55% conversion from comparable operating profit  \n1 Assuming the rate 1 EUR = 1.13 USD as of 31 Dec 2021 continues throughout 2022.2\u00a0\u00a0Please refer to Note 10, Performance measures, in the Financial statement information section included in Nokia Corporation Financial Report for Q4 and full year 2021 for a full explanation of how these terms are defined. \nOUTLOOK ASSUMPTIONS\nThe outlook, the long-term targets (3-5 years) and all of the underlying outlook assumptions described below are subject to risk factors as described in the Risk Factors section later in this release. All of the below outlook assumptions are new as they now refer to 2022 and over the longer-term.\nNokia\u2019s outlook assumptions for the comparable operating margin of each business group in 2022 are provided below:\n  \u00a0  \n  Full year 2022  \n  Mobile Networks  \n  6.5 to 9.5%  \n  Network Infrastructure  \n  9.5 to 12.5%  \n  Cloud and Network Services  \n  4.0 to 7.0%  \n  Nokia Technologies  \n  >75%  \nWe expect Nokia Technologies to deliver a largely stable operating profit performance in 2022 and over the longer-term;\nWe expect the net negative impact of Group Common and Other to be EUR 250 million in 2022 and over the longer-term;\nIn full year 2022, Nokia expects the free cash flow performance of Nokia Technologies to be approximately EUR 450 million lower than its operating profit, primarily due to prepayments we received from certain licensees in previous years;\nComparable financial income and expenses are expected to be an expense of approximately EUR 150-200 million in full year 2022 and over the longer-term;\nComparable income tax expenses are expected to be approximately EUR 450 million in full year 2022 and over the longer-term;\nCash outflows related to income taxes are expected to be approximately EUR 400 million in full year 2022 and over the longer-term;\nCapital expenditures are expected to be approximately EUR 650 million in full year 2022 and around EUR 600 million over the longer-term; and\nRule of thumb related to currency fluctuations: Assuming our current mix of net sales and total costs (refer to Note 1, Basis of Preparation, in the Financial statement information section included in Nokia Corporation Financial Report for Q4 and full year 2021 for details), we expect that a 10% increase in the EUR\/USD exchange rate would have an impact of approximately negative 4 to 5% on net sales and an approximately neutral impact on operating profit.\n\nLONG-TERM TARGETS\nWith Nokia\u2019s new 2022 guidance for comparable operating margin exceeding the prior 2023 outlook for comparable operating margin and to better reflect long-term ambitions, Nokia has replaced its prior 2023 outlook with long-term targets (3-5 years) for the business, as laid out below. These new targets are intended to show Nokia\u2019s plan to deliver continuous improvement over time in the business.\n  Net sales  \n  Grow faster than the market  \n  Comparable operating margin  \n  \u226514%  \n  Free cash flow  \n  55-85% conversion from comparable operating profit  \nRISK FACTORS\nNokia and its businesses are exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties which include but are not limited to: \nCompetitive intensity, which is expected to continue at a high level;\nOur ability to ensure competitiveness of our product roadmaps and costs through additional R&D investments;\nOur ability to procure certain standard components and the costs thereof, such as semiconductors;\nDisturbance in the global supply chain;\nScope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its economic impact;\nAccelerating inflation;\nOther macroeconomic, geopolitical, industry and competitive developments;\nTiming and value of new and existing patent licensing agreements with smartphone vendors, automotive companies, consumer electronics companies and other licensees;\nResults in brand and technology licensing; costs to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights; and the regulatory landscape for patent licensing;\nTiming of completions and acceptances of certain projects;\nOur product and regional mix;\nUncertainty in forecasting income tax expenses and cash outflows, over the long-term, as they are also subject to possible changes due to regional profit mix, net sales subject to withholding taxes, the timing of patent licensing cash flow and changes in tax legislation, including potential tax reform in the U.S. and OECD initiatives;\nOur ability to utilize our US and Finnish deferred tax assets and their recognition on our balance sheet;\nOur ability to meet our sustainability and other ESG targets, including our targets relating to greenhouse gas emissions;\nas well as the risk factors specified under Forward-looking Statements of this release, and our 2020 annual report on Form 20-F published on 4 March 2021 under Operating and financial review and prospects-Risk factors.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements herein that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.

The AI-based system applies computer vision and machine learning technologies for real-time monitoring and analysis, to ensure the safety of railroad crossings. As the first deployment of this kind in Europe, Nokia\u2019s collaboration with Schweizer Electronics and BLT demonstrated the reliability of AI-based railroad safety solutions for daily use.\nSafety of passengers and vehicles at level crossings remains a concern for rail authorities due to the threat of serious injury or loss of life in these areas. Statistics from the European Union identified around 250 fatalities and 300 serious injuries related to level crossings in the EU-28 countries in 2018[1]. Even the best warning systems can be bypassed, and crossings obstructed, making it essential for train operators to be alerted of issues in real-time.\nIntegrating Nokia Scene Analytics, BLT can use machine learning algorithms based on CCTV data to continually learn what is \u201cnormal\u201d or anomalous. In addition to reporting anomalies to railway security in real-time, the AI-based platform detects the object type, which provides a more complete picture of the situation at hand. Event based video clips, images and associated data are stored, enabling post-incident forensic analysis.\n\u00a0\nBesides improving safety and response time, the deployment of Scene Analytics on railroad crossings also increases operational efficiencies by minimizing downtime and delays. Its machine learning capability reduces the time investment required by rail personnel to manually update the system. In doing so, Nokia Scene Analytics provides train operators with much greater overall cost efficiency. It can also be integrated with many standard industry cameras, reducing the total cost of ownership, and increasing the return on investment.\nMichael Theiler, Head of Maintenance Electrical Systems at BLT, said: \u201cLevel crossings are notoriously difficult areas to ensure the safety of passengers, pedestrians, train operators and motorists. This deployment, in collaboration with Nokia represents an encouraging step towards using analytics as another layer of protection in dangerous areas. Nokia Scene Analytics acts as an intelligent set of \u2018eyes\u2019 and, by providing critical information in real-time, to prevent or mitigate the impact of an incident\u201d.\nRoland Liem, Head of Product Unit Railroad Safety at Schweizer Electronics, said: \u201cBy combining level crossing systems and Scene Analytics within a simple interface, this project with Nokia and BLT enabled us to automate the interaction between level crossing systems and alarms for enhanced safety.

However, other operating income was higher than expected including further benefits from venture fund investments, leading to a stronger comparable operating margin exceeding the 2021 guidance. \nBased on preliminary and unaudited financial results for 2021 Nokia now estimates net sales of approximately \u20ac22.2bn within its previous guidance of \u20ac21.7 to 22.7bn and a comparable operating margin of 12.4 to 12.6% above its previous guidance of 10 to 12%. The company estimates it has benefited from approximately 150bps of one-offs in financial year 2021 to its comparable operating margin (up from 100bps expected at our Q3 earnings) related to venture fund investments, a one-off software contract in Q2, bad debt provision reversals and some other one-time benefits.\nUpdated 2021 guidance based on preliminary and unaudited 2021 financials:\n    \u00a0    \n Previous (28 Oct \u201921)  \n Updated  \n    Net sales    \n    \u20ac21.7bn to \u20ac22.7bn1\n    Approx. \u20ac22.2bn    \n    Comparable operating margin    \n    10 to 12%    \n    12.4 to 12.6%    \n    Free cash flow    \n    Clearly positive    \n    Clearly positive    \n    Comparable ROIC    \n    17 to 21%    \n    17 to 21%    \n1 Assuming actual currency rates until Sept 2021 and end of Sept EUR\/USD rate of 1.16 continues in the remainder of 2021.\n2022 outlook:\nNokia is also introducing a new comparable operating margin guidance for financial year 2022 of 11% to 13.5%. This new guidance considers estimated continued improvements in the underlying business, supply constraints and cost inflation, with the year-on-year progression also impacted by the significant one-offs seen in 2021. \nThe company will release its fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results on Thursday 3 February 2022 when it will also revisit its longer-term outlook. \nNokia will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its fourth quarter performance and business outlook on 3 February 2022 at 11:30am EET \/ 9:30am BST \/ 4:30am US EST.\nAbout NokiaAt Nokia, we create technology that helps the world act together.\nAs a trusted partner for critical networks, we are committed to innovation and technology leadership across mobile, fixed and cloud networks.
