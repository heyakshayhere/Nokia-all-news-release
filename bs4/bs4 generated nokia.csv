Press Release
Nokia demonstrates live D-Band microwave backhaul connection
D-Band will be a valuable resource for ultra-high-capacity backhaul connectivity in dense urban environments 
13 April 2022 
Espoo, Finland – Nokia today announced that it has successfully demonstrated a live microwave connection utilizing D-Band spectrum (130-175 GHz). D-Band enables much higher bandwidth than other microwave bands and will serve as an ultra-high-capacity extension for 5G backhaul and fronthaul in dense urban environments. The trial, which was conducted by Nokia utilizing Nokia Bell Labs technology, is investigating how higher frequencies beyond 100 GHz, can support the increased capacity requirements of mobile networks.   
The proliferation of 5G networks has seen increasing demand for high-capacity, high-speed microwave backhaul to support evolving network requirements and growing traffic. This requires the use of higher frequency bands previously not used for this purpose. These bands can support large channel bandwidths and handle up to 50 times more traffic than microwave bands typically used for mobile network backhaul. D-Band is expected to be mostly used in dense urban environments, thanks to the small form factors of the products involved.
The trial used an integrated dual-transceiver using a 2 GHz channel bandwidth operating over a distance of approximately 200 meters; this solution was developed by Nokia Bell Labs. 
Giuseppe Targia, Vice President, Microwave Radio Links at Nokia said: “This trial demonstrates how we are continuing to push the boundaries to deliver best-in-class connectivity as the demand for 5G services grows. The D-Band will be important in delivering high-capacity 5G connectivity in the future. We continue to drive important innovations that support our customers with coverage and capacity where it is needed.”

Nokia to exit the Russian market, no impact to financial outlook 
Espoo, Finland – It has been clear for Nokia since the early days of the invasion of Ukraine that continuing our presence in Russia would not be possible. Over the last weeks we have suspended deliveries, stopped new business and are moving our limited R&D activities out of Russia. We can now announce we will exit the Russian market. During this process our priority continues to be the safety and wellbeing of our employees. 
For humanitarian reasons, Western governments have expressed concerns about the risk of critical telecommunication network infrastructure in Russia failing. They have also emphasized the importance of ensuring the continued flow of information and access to the internet which provides outside perspectives to the Russian people. Therefore, as we exit we will aim to provide the necessary support to maintain the networks and are applying for the relevant licenses to enable this support in compliance with current sanctions.
This is the most responsible course of action for Nokia to take as we exit the Russian market. 
Regarding the financial impact of the decision, Russia accounted for less than 2% of our net sales in 2021. Considering the strong demand we see in other regions – we do not expect this decision to impact our ability to achieve our 2022 outlook provided in the Nokia financial report for Q4 and full year 2021 issued on 3 February 2022. We expect this decision to lead to a provision in Q1 of approximately €100m which will impact our reported but not comparable financials.

Press Release
Nokia and Rakuten Mobile prove case for 1 Terabit per channel transmission in live network
Successful trial connects data centers located in the Kanto region
Trial demonstrates the capability to quickly and easily scale network capacity and efficiency over existing Nokia open optical line system infrastructure 
30 March 2022
Espoo, Finland and Tokyo, Japan – Nokia and Rakuten Mobile, Inc. today announced that the two companies have demonstrated the first live 1 Tb/s per channel transmission over Rakuten Mobile’s commercial Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexer (DWDM) network, a speed increase of 500% on Rakuten Mobile’s existing network running at 200 Gb/s. The trial took place over two days in January 2022 and connected data centers located 135 km apart in the Kanto region in Japan.
The 1 Tb/s speed was achieved using coherent transmission powered by Nokia’s Photonic Service Engine (PSE) supporting 1 Tb/s capacity over a 150 GHz optical spectrum. The trial demonstrated the ability to deliver 32 Tb/s per fiber in C-band which can be expanded to 64 Tbps by adding L-band over a Nokia DWDM line system used in Rakuten Mobile’s optical network, vital to providing maximum capacity for the ever-increasing data demands and to support the latest generations of routers delivering 800 Gb/s Ethernet. 
The Open Line System field trial, over Rakuten Mobile’s existing commercial network, used Nokia’s Photonic Service Engine inhouse Digital Signal Processor (DSP), a compact, high capacity, modular optical networking platform, optimized for Data Center Interconnect (DCI) applications over metro, regional and long haul. 
John Lancaster-Lennox, Head of Market Unit Japan, Nokia, said: “The 1 Terabit per channel trial demonstrated the capability to dramatically increase fiber capacity and future-proof the Rakuten Mobile network infrastructure to support new high speed data center interconnection.”
Rakuten Mobile is scaling up its network capacity to enable 5G connectivity, video, and new applications for its mobile subscribers and business partners.
Nokia’s 1 Tb/s solution enables Rakuten Mobile to reduce its footprint, improving operational expenditure and flexibility to rollout in data centers.
Tareq Amin, Representative Director and CEO of Rakuten Mobile, Inc., said: “We are delighted with the performance of 1 Tb/s per channel on our optical network in collaboration with Nokia. This technical milestone will allow us to maximize bits per fiber and achieve improved power efficiency. The enhanced capacity will also support our traffic growth, deliver higher bandwidth and enable Rakuten Mobile to provide new service offerings.”

Press Release
Nokia selected for Software Defined Network Controller trials for Vodafone’s fixed access network
First steps are proof-of-concept trials 
Solution helps Vodafone with goals for massive automation and providing network-as-a-platform (NaaP) customizable services
24 March 2022
Espoo, Finland – Nokia today announced it has been solely selected to work with Vodafone on the evolution of the software defined network manager and controller (SDN-M&C) services for the company’s multi-access fixed network technology. 
Under the agreement, both companies are conducting proof-of-concept trials in Europe. Based on the successful outcome of these trials, Vodafone and Nokia aim to deploy the technology more widely later this year.  
Vodafone is one of the largest fixed access providers in Europe with 143 million marketable Next Generation Network (NGN) broadband homes. The SDN management and control functions will be used to simplify, automate, visualize, optimize and enhance Vodafone’s broadband networks, and support Vodafone’s strategy of providing network-as-a-platform (NaaP) and other customizable services.
Gavin Young, Head of Fixed Access Centre of Excellence at Vodafone, said: “We are driving simplification and automation throughout our network and IT systems across Europe and Africa to further improve the customer experience and support the growing number of connected devices. The last few years have proven that the resilience of economies depend on our ability to quickly respond to changing societal needs. Nokia’s Altiplano solution will enable us to help our customers adapt to new developments even quicker.”
Vodafone is using the Altiplano SDN-M&C to build a single-pane-of-glass controller to automate its network operations. Vodafone selected Altiplano for its unique capability to work across its multi-generational, multi-technology and multi-vendor access networks.
Sandy Motley, President, Fixed Networks at Nokia, said: “Our SDN-M&C platform is built with openness in mind. Nokia’s SDN Controller platform provides open and standardized APIs and leverages open source where applicable. The result is our Altiplano Access Controller can manage and control any SDN-native, disaggregated, legacy and third-party equipment and is highly customizable to suit operator needs now and in the future. In addition to the rich set of built-in applications our customers can add their own or third-party applications to customize and further automate the network.”
In September, Vodafone announced it is working with Nokia and other partners for new broadband standards to pave the way for faster, open broadband networks.

Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia – Nokia today announced that it has been selected by TIME dotCom (TIME) for the supply and delivery of a DWDM optical network. With this nationwide rollout, Nokia will help TIME meet fast growing traffic demands by enhancing connectivity across data centers and cable landing stations in Malaysia with a highly resilient optical network. 
The optical network will connect multiple data centers, cable landing stations, and telecom exchanges spanning across peninsular Malaysia to Singapore and Thailand.
The deployment will feature Nokia’s 1830 PSS portfolio to provide a level of scalability for supporting a wide range of applications and services. The 1830 PSS platform will further allow TIME to deploy services rapidly, reduce network total cost of ownership, and extend network lifecycles. The deployment will also be supported by Nokia’s fifth generation PSE-V chipset and 400G multi-haul pluggable optics to power coherent transmission at the lowest possible cost per bit, with low power and space requirements. 
The optical solutions being deployed to further future-proof TIME’s network will offer customers enhanced service quality and higher speeds while TIME benefits from a simplified network that increases operational and cost efficiency. The solutions will also offer Nokia next generation iROADM line system capabilities with flexible grid, contentionless, directionless and colorless (CDC-F) optical add-drop and restoration features, which eliminates the need for on-site visits to change wavelength connectivity and simplifies network planning. Built-in Layer 0 GMPLS capability, combined with CDC-F, enables automated traffic restoration and network re-optimization for maximum network uptime and capacity utilization. 
Ang Thing Jiun, Chief Technology Officer of TIME dotCom, said: “We are delighted to partner with Nokia to unlock the full potential of our optical network in Malaysia. With this deployment, we aim to continue delivering high-speed best-in-class experiences to our customers while preparing to address the higher bandwidth demands of the future.”
Datuk Mohd Rauf Nasir, Managing Director of Malaysia at Nokia said: “Our optical solutions will enable TIME to differentiate their webscale service offerings while adding operational and cost efficiencies to their network. A DWDM optical network will further enable TIME to deliver superior service, capacity, and reliability to its customers.”

Press Release
Nokia extends partnership with T-Mobile Polska in ten-year deal 
The deal will cover network modernization and the introduction of new 5G services 
22 March 2022
Espoo, Finland – Nokia today announced that it has extended its partnership with T-Mobile Polska to include the modernization of the operator’s existing radio network infrastructure and rollout of 5G services. The move will support T-Mobile Poland’s strategy of maintaining technology leadership in the country and delivering best-in-class services to their customers.

T-Mobile Polska plans to utilize 4G and 5G Dynamic Spectrum Sharing on lower bands and later the 3.5 GHz spectrum band for 5G dense urban coverage. This will provide 5G coverage and capacity while simultaneously operating 4G LTE to meet user capacity requirements. These solutions will enable the operator to build on its existing network leadership and deliver 5G-related connectivity and capacity benefits to consumers while reducing complexity and increasing cost efficiency.  
Nokia will also provide services, including digital deployment, technical support for operations and maintenance, as well as professional services. Nokia has a long-standing partnership with T-Mobile Polska which has included the supply of all radio technologies, particularly the successful expansion of 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G DSS networks. Nokia has global R&D facilities with thousands of engineers in Wroclaw and Krakow.
Petri Pehkonen, CTIO at T-Mobile Polska, said: “5G supports our strategy of delivering best-in-class services to our customers including businesses. Thanks to this cooperation we will be able to provide the best solutions and products to our customers and business clients. We chose Nokia as our long-term partner to modernize our network infrastructure and introduce new 5G services due to their comprehensive range of solutions and we look forward to working with them moving forward.” 
Tommi Uitto, President of Mobile Networks at Nokia, said: “We are delighted to have been selected by T-Mobile to upgrade the operator’s existing network infrastructure across Poland, which will bring best in class 5G experiences to its customers. We’ve worked hand-in-hand with T-Mobile for a long time now and are proud that they trust in our technology leadership and product portfolio. I am glad to see this project taking shape with strong collaboration across our teams.”

Press Release 
Nokia’s SaaS-based Data Marketplace selected by Equideum Health to power its healthcare blockchain solutions
Equideum Health to use Nokia Data Marketplace (NDM), delivered through Nokia’s Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model, to enable a multi-party ecosystem
The collaboration will unlock diverse person-centric use cases by applying advanced technologies in data management, data exchange and blockchain
16 March 2022 
Espoo, Finland – Nokia today announced that it has been selected by Equideum Health to help the US-based company jointly develop and deliver healthcare use-cases by using Nokia’s Data Marketplace (NDM) solution delivered through its Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model.
NDM, launched in 2021, facilitates secure sharing of data and AI models in order to drive digital transformation and data monetization for ecosystem players. Taking those NDM capabilities in conjunction with its SaaS delivery model, Nokia will enable healthcare and life sciences blockchain leader Equideum Health to launch new use-cases faster and achieve time-to-value quicker. Equideum Health is a spin-off from ConsenSys, the leading Ethereum software company.
With the amount of healthcare-related data being generated at the network edge rising exponentially due to factors like increased usage of healthcare wearables and connected devices, the Equideum Exchange will securely process, enrich, assemble, and analyze data using blockchain, decentralized AI, and privacy-preserving technologies; and securely exchange this data in a multi-party ecosystem.
As part of that effort, the partnership aims to accelerate Equideum Health’s privacy-preserving Clinical Trials Matching capability. Currently, to shortlist patients for clinical trials, companies invest significant money and time in data acquisition, and face issues like poor data quality, compliance, and cost of intermediaries.
The collaboration aims to help pharmaceutical companies simplify and optimize the clinical trial life cycle through faster patient identification; the use of advanced patient consent mechanisms; patient remuneration via the use of digital wallets; and enhanced patient transparency on how data is being used.
Utilizing NDM through Nokia’s secure SaaS delivery model provides global reach and scalability of the solution; and, consumed via a monthly subscription, improves business agility while reducing operating costs.
Nokia and Equideum are scheduled to hold a webinar on April 14 to further discuss their partnership. More details can be found here.
Heather Leigh Flannery, Founder and Chief Executive Officer at Equideum Health, said: “Our mission is to drive health outcomes and equity by breaking down data silos and revolutionizing the way health and health-relevant information is accessed and shared. We are very pleased to be taking another step toward delivering on those goals through this partnership with Nokia and leveraging its NDM solution through its SaaS model.”
Friedrich Trawoeger, Senior Vice President, Cloud and Cognitive Services at Nokia, said: “Nokia Data Marketplace gives our customers a secure and compliant way to access distributed data sets, where AI/ML capabilities extract insights to improve healthcare. Nokia’s SaaS delivery model will allow us to scale our partnership with Equideum Health and help us realize our shared goals of providing world-class blockchain solutions to transform the healthcare sector.”

The network, already in operation after being deployed in a record four months for Minera Centinela, will initially connect a fleet of autonomous trucks. Going forward it will support a wide array of operations as part of a five-year digitalization plan which aims to transform the mining sector, while enabling safer and more efficient operations. 
Nokia designed and deployed the industrial-grade private 4.9G/LTE solution, including Nokia AirScale radio equipment, mobile packet core, IP/MPLS service aggregation routers, and Wavence microwave transmission. 
Gino Ivani, Technology Manager for Antofagasta Minerals, said: “We are transforming the way mining is done. We want to deliver excellence in everything we do, leveraging operational efficiencies to achieve the best results. We are committed to sustainable mining and to providing the safest and most efficient facilities. We are very pleased to leverage Nokia industrial-grade private wireless solutions and its experience in mining automation to support our efforts.”
Leonardo Serra, Corporate Head of IT Projects at Antofagasta Minerals, said: “Copper is critical for the delivery of clean energy and consequently to reduce emissions. As demand for copper increases, we are deploying technology innovations, such as Nokia private wireless connectivity, allowing us to enhance productivity in a smart and sustainable way.”
A Nokia-sponsored IDC infobrief revealed that safety is a key consideration when identifying initiatives for transformation, and that sustainability tops miners’ strategic objectives. The report quotes IDC’s 2021 Worldwide Mining Decision Maker Survey, which highlighted the increasing adoption of digital transformation strategies in mining with 86% of mining companies planning to invest in wireless infrastructure in the next 18 months.
Nokia industrial-grade private wireless networks can be deployed in the most remote locations and harshest environments, making it ideally suited for the digital transformation of mining facilities. Mine operators can take advantage of Industry 4.0 technology and applications that enable new levels of automation and autonomy to better manage fluctuations in demand, while enhancing productivity, operational efficiency, sustainability and workforce safety. Nokia currently has more than 420 private wireless enterprise customers globally, including over 35 mining customers in more than 60 mines.
Marcelo Entreconti, Head of Enterprise for Latin America at Nokia, said: “We are witnessing the first wave of Industry 4.0 projects in Latin America and it is very exciting to watch them become a reality for mining companies like Antofagasta Minerals. Nokia industrial-grade private wireless delivers the robust, secure, predictable and deep wireless coverage that mines require for large outdoor areas or underground complexes. Deploying these networks is considered the first and most important step in the digitalization journey of mining companies, and lays the groundwork for an expansion beyond connectivity where Nokia is already proposing solutions to the global mining community.”
Antofagasta’s Centinela open pit mine is located approximately 1,350 kilometers north of Santiago at an important mining zone with sulfur and oxides. The mine produces copper concentrate and cathodes, as well as molybdenum and gold. In August 2021, Centinela obtained the Copper Mark, which certifies that the company operates under strict internationally recognized sustainable production standards.

Press Release
Nokia and Hrvatski Telekom conduct first 25G PON fiber broadband trial in Croatia
10 March 2022
Espoo, Finland – Nokia has today announced it has completed a successful 25Gb/second fiber broadband trial with Hrvatski Telekom, part of Deutsche Telekom Group (DTAG). The trial took place at Hrvatski Telekom’s laboratory in Rijeka, Croatia and was the first in the country to use 25G PON technology, and one of first trials with a DTAG company. 
Sandy Motley, President, Fixed Networks at Nokia, said: “As fiber access networks develop, Communications Service Providers are now looking beyond the immediate needs of residential customers at new applications for enterprise customers and to support their own mobile networks with backhaul. 25G PON, which is available today with our Quillion powered fiber nodes, is an easy solution to immediately add scale and capacity and only requires a change in optics for operation.”
Boris Drilo, CTO at Hrvatski Telekom, said: “This demo shows that our FTTH network is fully compliant with the cutting-edge PON technology that will radically increase the capacity, bandwidth and quality of our broadband service in the future. By already deploying Nokia’s single multipurpose G/XGS-/25G PON platform, we are showing exciting capabilities of the largest fiber network in Croatia capable of the fastest possible speeds.”
Notes to editors 
Nokia’s 25G PON solution utilizes the world’s first implementation of 25G PON technology and includes Lightspan and ISAM access nodes, Quillion based Multi-PON line cards and fiber modems.
Dependent on the optics chosen, 25G PON supports symmetrical bitrates (25Gb/s in downstream and 25G in upstream) and asymmetrical bitrates (25/10).
Usually located in telecom central offices, Nokia’s high-capacity access nodes are deployed for massive scale fiber roll-outs. They connect thousands of users via optical fibre, aggregate their broadband traffic and send it deeper in the network. The fiber access nodes can support multiple fiber technologies including GPON, XGS-PON, 25G PON and Point-to-Point Ethernet to deliver a wide range of services with the best fit technology.
Nokia ONT (Optical Network Termination) devices, or fiber modems, are located at the user location. They terminate the optical fibre connection and delivers broadband services within the user premises or cell sites.

Press Release
Nokia selected by Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison as prime supplier in multi-year network expansion deal
Nokia's solution will help Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison expand its 4G coverage while paving the way for the continuation of 5G deployment in the near future 

4 March 2022
Espoo, Finland – Nokia today announced that it has been selected by Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison (IOH) as the principal vendor to deploy and expand its 4G and 5G network across Indonesia in a three-year deal. The comprehensive deal, which will see Nokia provide solutions from its latest AirScale portfolio, will cover an area of 1.4 million square kilometers including Sumatra island, Kalimantan island, Central Java and Surabaya city. The project will support Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison’s ambitions to become the most preferred digital telco in the country by addressing market requirements, improving data throughput and customer experience and preparing the network for early 5G deployments. The rollout is expected to begin this month. 
Nokia will provide equipment from its latest ReefShark-powered AirScale portfolio including base stations and 5G Single RAN for both premium indoor and outdoor coverage. Nokia’s consolidation services will ensure a smooth integration by merging spectrum owned by IOH into a single network, ensuring minimum impact to end-users. 
With Nokia's technology, Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison will be able to quickly and easily upgrade to 5G services remotely with a software update or with a plug-in card. Nokia's energy-efficient AirScale solution will also allow IOH to keep cost to a minimum while improving the quality of its services. 
Vikram Sinha, President Director and CEO of Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison, said: ""We are excited to collaborate with our long-standing partner Nokia on this crucial project to consolidate and expand our networks for optimal utilization of our resources while providing a world-class digital experience to our subscribers. Nokia's 5G-ready and industry-leading solution will help us maximize the asset utilization even as we future-proof our investments and enhance network performance.""
Tommi Uitto, President of Mobile Networks at Nokia, said: “We are looking forward to supporting Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison in this crucial initiative to expand its coverage footprint and prepare the networks for more innovative 5G services in the near future. Nokia's 5G-ready AirScale portfolio will help Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison to launch next-generation services while helping it to bring down its operational expense.”

It is not possible for the shareholders or their proxy representatives to participate in the Meeting at the meeting venue. 
The Board of Directors of the Company has resolved on extraordinary measures pursuant to the temporary legislative act (375/2021) which entered into force on 8 May 2021. In order to restrict the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Annual General Meeting will be held without shareholders’ and their proxy representatives’ presence at the Meeting venue. This is necessary in order to organize the Meeting in a predictable way allowing equal means for shareholders to participate while also ensuring the health and safety of the shareholders, employees and other stakeholders of the Company. 
It is possible to follow the Annual General Meeting through a webcast. Instructions regarding the webcast will be available on the Company’s website www.nokia.com/agm. It is not possible to ask questions, make counterproposals or vote through the webcast, and following the webcast is not considered as participation or exercise of shareholder rights in the Meeting.
After the Annual General Meeting on 5 April 2022 at 16:00 EEST the webcast will continue with a live Q&A event where the shareholders have the opportunity to present questions to the Company's management on subjects related to the Annual General Meeting. The Q&A event is not part of the Annual General Meeting and questions presented at the Q&A event are not deemed to be made at the Annual General Meeting. Questions presented to the Annual General Meeting pursuant to Chapter 5, Section 25 of the Finnish Companies Act are therefore required to be asked in advance in accordance with the instructions given in section C of this notice. Instructions regarding the webcast for the Q&A event will be available on the Company’s website www.nokia.com/agm.
A. Matters on the agenda of the Annual General Meeting
At the Annual General Meeting, the following matters will be considered:
1. Opening of the Meeting
2. Matters of order for the Meeting
The Chair of the Meeting will be Seppo Kymäläinen, attorney-at-law. 
In case Seppo Kymäläinen would not be able to act as the Chair of the Meeting for a weighty reason, the Board of Directors will name another person it deems most suitable to act as the Chair of the Meeting.
3. Election of a person to confirm the minutes and a person to verify the counting of votes
The person to confirm the minutes and to verify the counting of votes will be Marjo Westergård, the Company’s Senior Legal Counsel. 
In case Marjo Westergård would not be able to act as the person to confirm the minutes and to verify the counting of votes for a weighty reason, the Board of Directors will name another person it deems most suitable to act in that role.
4. Recording the legal convening of the Meeting and quorum
5. Recording the attendance at the Meeting and adoption of the list of votes
The shareholders who have voted in advance and who have the right to participate in the Meeting pursuant to Chapter 5 Sections 6 and 6a of the Finnish Companies Act will be recorded to have attended the Meeting. The list of votes will be adopted according to the information provided by Euroclear Finland Oy.
6. Presentation of the Annual Accounts, the review by the Board of Directors and the auditor’s report for the financial year 2021
As participation in the Meeting is possible only in advance, the “Nokia in 2021” annual report, which includes the Company’s Annual Accounts, the review by the Board of Directors and the auditor’s report is deemed to have been presented to the Meeting once it is published in week 9 of 2022, after which it is available on the Company’s website www.nokia.com/agm.
7. Adoption of the Annual Accounts
The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting adopt the Annual Accounts.
8. Resolution on the use of the profit shown on the balance sheet and authorization of the Board of Directors to decide on the distribution of dividend and assets from the invested unrestricted equity fund
The distributable funds on the balance sheet of the Company as at 31 December 2021 were EUR 17 282 854 713.47, of which the profit for the financial year 2021 was EUR 482 256 270.12.
The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that based on the balance sheet to be adopted for the financial year ended on 31 December 2021, no dividend is distributed by a resolution of the Annual General Meeting. Instead, the Board proposes to be authorized to decide on the distribution of an aggregate maximum of EUR 0.08 per share as dividend and/or as assets from the invested unrestricted equity fund. 
The authorization will be used to distribute dividend and/or equity repayment in four installments during the period of validity of the authorization unless the Board of Directors decides otherwise for a justified reason. The authorization would be valid until the opening of the next Annual General Meeting. The Board would make separate resolutions on the amount and timing of each distribution of the dividend and/or equity repayment so that the preliminary record and payment dates for the dividend and/or equity repayment will be as set out below. The Company shall make a separate announcement of each such Board resolution.                
 Preliminary record date         
 Preliminary payment date 
 3 May 2022 
 12 May 2022 
 26 July 2022 
 4 August 2022 
 25 October 2022 
 3 November 2022 
 7 February 2023 
 16 February 2023 
The dividend and/or equity repayment based on the resolution of the Board of Directors will be paid to a shareholder registered in the Company’s shareholders’ register maintained by Euroclear Finland Oy on the record date of the dividend and/or equity repayment.
Based on the total number of shares in the Company on the date of this proposal, the authorization would be equal to an approximate maximum of EUR 456 million. The proposed total authorization for dividend and/or equity repayment is in line with the Company’s dividend policy.
Since the Board has proposed that instead of an immediate dividend resolution, the Board would be authorized by the Annual General Meeting to decide on the dividend and/or equity repayment as set forth above, the shareholders have the right, in deviation from the Board’s proposal, to demand a minority dividend, pursuant to Chapter 13 Section 7 of the Finnish Companies Act. The minority dividend must be distributed, if a demand to this effect is made by shareholders who have at least one tenth of all shares. The amount of minority dividend is EUR 241 128 135.06, which corresponds to half of the profit of the financial year. A shareholder demanding minority dividend may vote for the minority dividend in advance voting, and no separate demand or counterproposal is required. The Board has informed that it would take the potential distribution of minority dividend into account as a reduction in the amount of funds to be distributed based on the authorization, provided that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board to decide on the distribution of funds as proposed.
9. Resolution on the discharge of the members of the Board of Directors and the President and CEO from liability for the financial year 2021
10. Addressing the Remuneration Report 
As participation in the Meeting is possible only in advance, the Company’s Remuneration Report is deemed to have been presented to the Meeting once it has been published by a stock exchange release in week 9 of 2022, after which it is available on the Company’s website www.nokia.com/agm. The resolution to adopt the Remuneration Report is advisory.
11. Resolution on the remuneration to the members of the Board of Directors
To ensure the competitiveness of the Board remuneration and reflecting the fee development in Nokia’s global peer group, the Board’s Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee has resolved to recommend to the Board that the annual fees of Board members, save for the Chair of the Board, would be proposed to be increased with EUR 10 000. Other remuneration payable to the Board and Committee members would remain unchanged, including the annual fee of the Chair of the Board and the Company’s practice according to which no additional annual fees are paid to the Chair of the Board for service in any of the Board Committees.
Consequently, on the recommendation of the Board’s Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee and in line with the Company’s Remuneration Policy, the Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the annual fee payable to Board members for a term ending at the close of the next Annual General Meeting be as follows:
EUR 440 000 for the Chair of the Board;
EUR 195 000 for the Vice Chair of the Board; 
EUR 170 000 for each member of the Board;
EUR 30 000 each for the Chairs of the Audit Committee and the Personnel Committee and EUR 20 000 for the Chair of the Technology Committee as an additional annual fee; and
EUR 15 000 for each member of the Audit Committee and Personnel Committee and EUR 10 000 for each member of the Technology Committee as an additional annual fee.
The Board of Directors proposes that approximately 40 percent of the annual fee be paid in Nokia shares purchased from the market on behalf of the Board members or alternatively by using treasury shares held by the Company. The rest of the annual fee will be payable in cash to cover taxes arising from the remuneration. The directors shall retain until the end of their directorship such number of shares that corresponds to the number of Nokia shares they have received as Board remuneration during their first three years of service in the Board. 
In addition, the Board proposes that the meeting fees for Board and Board Committee meetings payable to all the other Board members, except for the Chair of the Board, remain at current level. These meeting fees based on travel required between the Board member’s home location and the location of a meeting would be paid for a maximum of seven meetings per term as follows:
EUR 5 000 per meeting requiring intercontinental travel; and
EUR 2 000 per meeting requiring continental travel.
Only one meeting fee would be payable in the usual case of multiple Board and Board Committee meetings per eligible travel. 
Moreover, it is proposed that members of the Board of Directors shall be compensated for travel and accommodation expenses as well as other costs directly related to Board and Board Committee work. The meeting fees, travel expenses and other expenses directly related to Board and Board Committee work will be paid in cash. 
12. Resolution on the number of members of the Board of Directors 
On the recommendation of the Board’s Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee, the Board proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the number of Board members be ten (10). 
13. Election of members of the Board of Directors 
Kari Stadigh, the Vice Chair of the Board, has informed the Board’s Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee that he will no longer be available to serve on the Nokia Board of Directors after the Annual General Meeting. The Board proposes, on the recommendation of the Board’s Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee, that the following current Board members be re-elected as members of the Board of Directors for a term until the close of the next Annual General Meeting: Sari Baldauf, Bruce Brown, Thomas Dannenfeldt, Jeanette Horan, Edward Kozel, Søren Skou and Carla Smits-Nusteling. In addition, it is proposed that Lisa Hook, former President and Chief Executive Officer of Neustar, Inc., Thomas Saueressig, member of the Executive Board of SAP SE and Global Head of SAP Product Engineering, and Kai Öistämö, President and Chief Executive Officer of Vaisala Corporation, be elected as new members of the Board of Directors for the same term of office.
The Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee intends to propose in the assembly meeting of the new Board of Directors to be held after the Annual General Meeting that Sari Baldauf be re-elected as Chair of the Board and Søren Skou as new Vice Chair of the Board, subject to their election to the Board of Directors.
All Board member candidates have been determined to be independent of the Company and of the Company’s significant shareholders under the Finnish Corporate Governance Code and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, as applicable. 
The biographical details of all Board member candidates are presented on the Company’s website www.nokia.com/agm. 
14. Resolution on the remuneration of the Auditor
On the recommendation of the Board’s Audit Committee, the Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the auditor to be elected for the financial year 2023 be reimbursed based on the invoice of the auditor and in compliance with the purchase policy approved by the Board’s Audit Committee.
15. Election of Auditor for the financial year 2023
Since 2019, the Board of Directors has proposed to the Annual General Meeting that the shareholders would elect the auditor for the financial year commencing next after the election. Therefore, on the recommendation of the Board’s Audit Committee, the Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that Deloitte Oy be re-elected as the auditor of the Company for the financial year 2023.
Deloitte Oy has informed the Company that the auditor in charge would be Authorized Public Accountant Marika Nevalainen.
16. Authorization to the Board of Directors to resolve to repurchase the Company’s own shares
The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorize the Board of Directors to resolve to repurchase a maximum of 550 million shares, which corresponds to less than 10 percent of the Company’s total number of shares. The repurchases under the authorization are proposed to be carried out by using funds in the unrestricted equity, as resolved by the Board of Directors, which means that the repurchases will reduce the distributable funds of the Company.
The price paid for the shares under the authorization shall be based on the market price of Nokia share on the securities markets on the date of the repurchase or a price otherwise formed in a competitive process. Shares may be repurchased to be cancelled, held to be reissued, transferred further or for other purposes resolved by the Board of Directors. The Company may enter into derivative, share lending or other arrangements customary in capital market practice. 
The shares may be repurchased otherwise than in proportion to the shares held by the shareholders (directed repurchase). 
The Board shall resolve on all other matters related to the repurchase of Nokia shares. 
It is proposed that the authorization be effective until 4 October 2023 and terminate the authorization for repurchasing the Company’s shares granted by the Annual General Meeting on 8 April 2021 to the extent that the Board has not previously resolved to repurchase shares based on such authorization.
17. Authorization to the Board of Directors to resolve to issue shares and special rights entitling to shares
The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorize the Board of Directors to resolve to issue in total a maximum of 550 million shares through issuance of shares or special rights entitling to shares under Chapter 10, Section 1 of the Finnish Companies Act in one or more issues during the effective period of the authorization. The Board of Directors may issue either new shares or treasury shares held by the Company. The proposed maximum amount corresponds to less than 10 percent of the Company’s total number of shares as of the date of this proposal. 
Shares and special rights entitling to shares may be issued in deviation from the shareholders’ pre-emptive rights within the limits set by law. The authorization may be used to develop the Company’s capital structure, diversify the shareholder base, finance or carry out acquisitions or other arrangements, settle the Company’s equity-based incentive plans or for other purposes resolved by the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors shall resolve on all terms and conditions of the issuance of shares and special rights entitling to shares under Chapter 10, Section 1 of the Finnish Companies Act.
It is proposed that the authorization be effective until 4 October 2023 and terminate the authorization for issuance of shares and special rights entitling to shares resolved at the Annual General Meeting on 8 April 2021.

Press Release
Nokia launches next generation OTN architecture for wholesale services
OTN is a foundational multi-service networking technology for optical transport and wholesale services, with increasing scale needed to support network growth, and new services and business models
Platform upgrades enable scaling up to 48Tb/s of switching capacity, add new WDM uplinks with 90 Gbaud coherent optics, and new service interfaces to support 400Gigabit Ethernet (400GE) services
3 March 2022
Espoo, Finland – Nokia has today announced a wide range of upgrades for its next-generation packet optical transport network (P-OTN) solutions needed by CSPs offering wholesale services.
Upgrades to Nokia’s 1830 PSS-x solutions include a doubling of switching capacity up to a market-leading 48Tb/s, new wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) uplinks based on Nokia’s fifth-generation Photonic Service Engines (PSE-V) and expanding the range of wholesale service options with new client interfaces supporting 400GE service transport, and a wide range of hard and soft isolation features for network slicing.
According to Ian Redpath, Practice Leader for Transport Networks at Omdia, coherent port bandwidth grew by 49% to 227 Pbps in 2021, providing significant opportunities for Communication Service Providers to offer new services and grow revenue through wholesale service delivery. The wholesale business model can support deterministic end-to-end services across both traditional services and new segments such as mobile network slicing and backhaul, data center interconnect, wholesale transport for retail CSPs and business customers, smart power grids and residential broadband backhaul, who all bring their own requirements in speed, latency, availability and security.

Press Release
Nokia adds Liquid Cooling technology to latest AirScale Base Station portfolio outlining commitment to sustainability #MWC22
Nokia’s unique Liquid Cooling baseband solution is now commercially available in latest Nokia AirScale product line-up  
AT&T is piloting the solution in a live customer trial in Philadelphia, U.S
Liquid Cooling technology underlines Nokia's commitment to sustainability and combatting climate change
1 March 2022
Espoo, Finland – Nokia today announced the commercial availability of its innovative Liquid Cooling AirScale portfolio. Nokia’s first-of-its-kind solution is designed to make radio networks more sustainable and cost-efficient by reducing the energy required to cool a base station. Cooling system energy consumption can be reduced up to 90 percent and base station CO2 emissions up to 80 percent compared to traditional active air-cooling systems1. The move supports Nokia's ambitions to have the most energy-efficient, zero-emission 5G product portfolio in the industry. Commercial products will be available from Q3 2022. Nokia also announced that AT&T is piloting the solution in a live network trial in Philadelphia, U.S.
Nokia’s liquid-cooled AirScale baseband solution can accommodate any liquid-cooled common or capacity plug-in unit and supports all radio access technologies from 2G to 5G. It supports the reduction of base station-related CO2 emissions by up to 80 percent. Nokia’s Liquid Cooling solution is also almost completely silent and maintenance-free making it ideal for apartment buildings, whereas more traditional air-cooling systems are typically noisy and require regular maintenance. Liquid is much more efficient in the transmission and transfer of heat. Nokia’s solution carries the captured waste heat produced by the base station during operation. This can then be circulated and reused for other purposes, for example, it can be redirected to a building’s heating system for free, at a price, or even traded.
Nokia is committed to leading the decarbonization of the telecommunications industry and helping other industries and communities to decarbonize and dematerialize through digitalization. Digitalization is critical for making industries more sustainable resulting in less waste, more resource-efficient, and more productive. Nokia has set a science-based target to reduce its emissions by 50 percent by 2030 across its value chain, including its operations, products in use, logistics, and final assembly supplier factories. Nokia has also been increasing its share of renewable electricity and is committed to reaching 100 percent by 2025.
Experience Liquid Cooling at MWC22 Barcelona
At MWC22, Nokia will showcase how its products and services can reduce CO2 emissions and the cost of energy and help its customers to take control of their sustainability targets. Nokia will demonstrate its AirScale Radios with energy-efficient software features as well as its ​Liquid-cooled AirScale Baseband and Wavence microwave radio energy innovations.
Joe Taylor, VP Implementation, Provisioning & Optimization at AT&T, said: “AT&T is committed to tackling climate change, enhancing the efficiency of our network, and reducing our operational carbon footprint. We’re pleased to work with Nokia as we take a more sustainable path and to trial its liquid-cooled base station in our network. We firmly believe that sustainability is one of the biggest factors impacting the world right now and is a key differentiator in business. We’re eager to continue aligning with like-minded, innovative companies like Nokia that are developing ground-breaking solutions to combat climate change.”
Daryl Schoolar, Research Director at IDC, said: “Controlling total cost of network ownership remains an important priority for mobile operators. A significant portion of that total cost of ownership comes from operating expenses. Network solutions that can lower those operating expenses, which includes cost of energy, are certainly welcomed by mobile operators. Also, if those solutions can help an operator achieve its green energy goals, that is just another added plus.”
Tommi Uitto, President of Mobile Networks at Nokia, said: “There is no green without digital and the commercial availability of Nokia’s liquid cooling technology across our AirScale portfolio highlights our commitment to leading the industry to become more sustainable through digitalization. Our innovative, game-changing solution reduces energy consumption, costs, and carbon emissions and helps mobile operators become more environmentally responsible. 5G networks and technologies will play a critical role in making other industries more sustainable and we must all play our part to minimize our footprint and accelerate the use of green electricity.”

1 March 2022
Espoo, Finland – Nokia today announced the launch of its cloud-native solution, Adaptive Cloud Networking, to transform service provider cloud networks to be consumable, agile and automated. The comprehensive solution is designed to respond to the unpredictable demands of the 5G era by supercharging a service provider’s data center fabric and seamlessly extending its operations to the edge clouds. This innovation in the way telco clouds are built and operated will enable service providers to reinforce their critical role in the 5G digital network value chain.
5G networks are pushing the limits of existing data center fabrics and edge cloud infrastructures: cloud native designs drive the agility and dynamicity of applications, and low latency performance requires those applications to be delivered from edge clouds close to end users. Data center fabrics need to adjust to these new demands. A new NetOps era is emerging – one that provides the tools and capabilities that allow service providers to transform their networks to become more efficient and productive and increase both service revenue and ARPU.
Nokia’s comprehensive Adaptive Cloud Networking solution helps service providers overcome these challenges to deliver a consumable, agile and automated network. A consumable network provides a needed foundation of openness, extensibility, visibility and control to access network data to optimize network operations. An agile network adapts to the constantly changing scale and performance required from the application layer, ensuring needed elastic scalability as dictated by the applications. An automated network supercharges network operations by making various built-in automation tools available throughout the network’s lifecycle.
Nokia’s Adaptive Cloud Networking solution provides these values in three key areas of the service provider network – the data center fabric, the rapidly emerging edge cloud, and the seamless inter-connectivity needed across the WAN, connecting applications across the WAN to different parts of the network.
The solution leverages Nokia’s proven data center fabric elements, including the SR Linux network operating system, the Fabric Services System and the Nokia 7220 and 7250 IXR hardware platforms; the newly introduced Edge Network Controller, designed specifically for the automation of the network in edge clouds; and Nokia’s Network Services Platform (NSP) for programmable automation, connecting data centers and edge clouds across the wide area network (WAN).
Kalle Lehtinen, CTO, Elisa, said: “With Adaptive Cloud Networking, having the capability to extend the flexibility and dynamicity of a cloud to the network and interconnecting services in different cloud environments, will further enhance Elisa’s position as the global leading digital service provider in automating operations. Applications in a cloud are able to consume the network as a dynamic resource in which the network automatically adapts to changes in service demand. This is a big benefit for Elisa’s 5G deployments. Elisa is a telecommunications market leader in Finland where its 5G network already covers over 70% of the population.”
Paul Parker-Johnson, Chief Analyst and Practice Lead for Cloud and Virtual System Infrastructures, ACG Research, said: “Delivering cloud-native networks and application services effectively in the future will rely on enhanced data center fabrics built from the start for cloud-native operations, from core to edge. Cloud-native networking fabrics need a strong foundation of open, standards-based protocols and data models, broad software modularity, dynamic and complete alignment with service intent, and rich automation at every layer of operation. Nokia has heard these requirements from customers clearly and its solution incorporates what is most important for use in service providers’ distributed clouds. Combined with its experience delivering solutions at scale in operator mobile, IP/MPLS/Segment Routing, edge, and SD-WAN deployments, and use of rich automation in each of those domains, Nokia’s Adaptive Cloud Networking presents an innovative, scalable, and agile solution to use as the foundation of operators’ cloud-native services.”
Vach Kompella, Vice President, IP Networks Division, Nokia, said: “Nokia’s Adaptive Cloud Networking is about automating every phase of the data center fabric and network lifecycle, including design, deployment and operations. Intent-based automation capabilities can be implemented every step of the way, supercharging service provider operational productivity without having to expand staff and skill set. We’re pleased to offer service providers a complete solution that will help them transform their business both now and into the future.”
Adaptive Cloud Networking combined with Nokia’s new 5G Edge Slicing solution opens additional opportunities for service providers to create value for enterprises.
The following Nokia products comprise the Adaptive Cloud Networking solution:
For the data center fabrics:
​At the heart of the data center fabric solution is Nokia’s SR Linux network operating system (NOS), which was built from the ground up to provide an open, extensible model-driven architecture, providing uncompromised visibility, resulting in a network that is highly consumable.
The Nokia Fabric Services System is a data center fabric management and automation platform that provides next generation data center fabric automation capabilities. Service providers can provide intent-based automation across their entire data center fabric lifecycle from Day 0, Day 1, and Day 2+.
The Fabric Services System provides comprehensive integration into the leading cloud management platforms and leverages a plugin infrastructure to keep the network agile and in “lockstep” with the applications it serves.
As part of the Nokia Fabric Services System is the Digital Sandbox, a digital twin of the production networks that can provide service providers programmable testing and validation of network changes before deployment.​
Service providers can build open and automated data center fabrics with the 7220 Interconnect Router (IXR), Nokia’s high-performance, fixed-configuration platforms; and its modular, high-performance 7250 Interconnect Router (IXR) platforms.
For edge cloud network automation:
The new Nokia Edge Network Controller is a lightweight Kubernetes application designed specifically for edge cloud locations, which are both space and cost constrained. It enables operators to improve network agility and programmability while ensuring services delivery with ultra-reliability and low-latency requirements. It is unique because it is built within a Kubernetes system, making the IP network components of the edge cloud consumable by the entire Kubernetes ecosystem and its wealth of tools and applications, enabling a consistent orchestration of containers and networks.
The Edge Network Controller supports both the SR Linux and the Nokia Service Router Operating System (SR OS). With its plug-in architecture, it is designed to support any modern network operating system that uses advanced data models.
For seamless interconnect:
Nokia’s NSP is an intent-based network automation platform that assures application SLAs across any IP network. A key part of Nokia’s Adaptive Cloud Networking solution, the NSP ensures the connectivity needed to span the WAN to connect data centers and edge clouds with stringent performance.​

Press Release
Nokia and AT&T collaborating to improve 5G uplink with distributed massive MIMO
Distributed massive MIMO technology leads to uplink gains without sacrificing downlink performance
Prototype of distributed massive MIMO lab system deployed and tested at AT&T Labs  
Simulations have shown an increase in 5G uplink capacity between 60% and 90%
28 February 2022
        
Espoo, Finland – Nokia today announced Bell Labs is pioneering distributed massive MIMO (DmMIMO) with AT&T, an innovation that significantly increases uplink capacity and speeds in 5G networks without requiring an overly complex solution. 
The enormous demand from new user experiences in the 5G-Advanced era will require greater uplink performance from networks. DmMIMO allows devices to leverage signal propagation to multiple cells or antenna panels in a network when establishing a link, thereby turning noise into a useful signal and increasing the uplink throughput. The data transmission is pieced together from multiple antenna panels and cell sites through distributed baseband processing. The processing load between the cell site radio units and the central processing unit is split in a novel way, reducing the fronthaul capacity to cell sites and hence lowering the cost.
Nokia is collaborating with AT&T on the validation of DmMIMO and testing the proof-of-concept technology in the AT&T labs. Bell Labs’s DmMIMO simulations have demonstrated increases in 5G uplink capacity between 60% and 90% compared to similarly configured systems with a single panel. While other techniques come at the expense of downlink capacity, DmMIMO would produce sizable increases in uplink capacity without sacrificing performance.
AT&T Labs is providing expertise in validating new cutting-edge technologies in the lab and in the field. For example, AT&T Labs provided network deployment details for specific cities, which has been used for detailed ray-traced simulations to understand the benefits of DmMIMO in real-world scenarios. Bell Labs is also benefiting from AT&T Labs’ 5G Testbed facilities with rooftops and poles connected by dedicated fiber networks to server racks in a lab environment. This capability enables experimentation to validate and improve the technology, leading to more effective deployment of the DmMIMO technology in the future.
Nishant Batra, Chief Strategy and Technology Officer, Nokia, said: “Addressing uplink speeds is becoming critical as consumers are increasingly becoming content creators as well as content consumers, video conferencing has become a cornerstone of the teleworking era, and many of the applications in the industrial internet of things require higher uplink speeds. When 5G-Advanced networks come online, we will see the network enhanced in multiple dimensions, expanding and extending its capabilities. Even today, with the focus on 5G mid-band spectrum rollouts in the U.S., there are opportunities for technologies like this that can maximize available resources. We feel distributed massive MIMO will be a critical element of networking in the 5G-Advanced era to help meet these demands with significant gains in uplink without a hit to downlink performance. Three decades ago, Bell Labs and AT&T invented MIMO, so it is only fitting that we continue this groundbreaking work together for the next generation of MIMO.”
Andre Fuetsch, Executive Vice President & CTO Network Services, AT&T, said: “AT&T and Nokia have a long history of working together on new network technologies, and I welcome this strategic collaboration for the development of distributed massive MIMO technology. Newer applications in the 5G-Advanced timeframe, such as eXtended Reality (XR), are expected to be more demanding on the uplink compared to regular broadband traffic. Technologies such as distributed massive MIMO show potential to improve uplink capacity in the right scenarios. DmMIMO is also a technology that shows potential for the next generation of wireless networks. Therefore, this strategic technology collaboration with Nokia may help provide learnings with long-term benefits to both companies.”
In addition to uplink improvements, the move to DmMIMO has the potential to alter the configuration of networks by facilitating deployments with smaller antenna arrays per site. This will lower weight, which in turn will result in smaller and lighter components as well as reduced power consumption. In alternate configurations, DmMIMO can also be used to boost downlink capacity, granting operators incredible flexibility in how they deploy the technology.

Press Release 
Nokia introduces evolved managed operations portfolio to help CSPs accelerate digital transformation and 5G monetization #MWC22
The new services are an evolution of Nokia’s Managed Services offering for CSPs and Enterprises, using a catalogue of modular operations services to help increase business objectives
Operations Transformation is aimed at increasing productivity and agility of network operations; Operations Intelligence is aimed at helping CSPs increase Net Promoter Scores with customers and realize returns on their 5G investment
Nokia-commissioned research of 50 CSPs globally verifies the positive impact operations partners bring to CSPs in terms of digital transformation and 5G monetization
	 
23 February 2022 
Espoo, Finland – Nokia today announced two new managed services offerings to help communication service providers (CSPs) deliver a better customer experience and realize faster returns on their 5G investments by better utilizing intelligence from their network data.
Operations Transformation is a multi-year service with a focus on guiding CSPs to enhance productivity and agility of their operations through cloudification and automation. The second new managed operations offering is called Operations Intelligence, which uses AI driven analytics using massive datasets to precisely pinpoint issues, with the end goal of enabling CSPs to increase business outcomes like Net Promoter Scores (NPS) and returns on their 5G investments. NPS serve as a barometer of how likely a customer would recommend a provider or service to another user.
Both services follow a methodology where modular operations services focus on the biggest improvement areas. The method is designed to follow a CSP’s unique digital transformation journey and deliver tangible results in an outcome-based business model, giving flexibility and control. The micro-operations services catalogue includes use cases ranging from coverage and capacity optimization to predictive analysis of anomalies in complex network settings in order to prevent the degradation of customer services; and leverages Nokia AVA’s AI use case library.
Nokia has been delivering commercial projects for the new two services with various CSP customers that have already started to yield solid results, including some CSPs in Asia Pacific and Africa which have been able to reach the leading position in customer NPS and network performance. In other cases, CSPs have been able to keep their operating costs flat despite seeing network growth increase 50%, while also achieving higher network availability with 60% less variance in performance.
The new services coincide with the release of new Nokia-commissioned research, based on a survey of around 50 CSPs globally, which shows that most CSPs value their operations partners support in their digital transformation, according to 84% of respondents.
CPSs also recognize the impact of their operations partners support in realizing higher returns on 5G and other major investments, according to 84% respondents; 81% report a positive effect of the partnerships on their customer’s experiences.
According to 65% and 69% of respondents, controlling capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenditure (OPEX), respectively, are top value drivers, an unexpected departure given that CAPEX and OPEX have long been traditional CSP priorities.
The survey also found that, according to 74% of respondents, CSPs want to add new responsibilities to their operations partners with the needs being widespread. CSPs are counting on their operations partners to help them with network security, AI/ML, data management, and cloud architectures.
More details on the research, which was conducted by GlobalData, can be found here.  
John Byrne, Service Director at GlobalData, said: “Our research shows that Communication Service providers are acutely aware that their competitiveness depends both on making network operations more efficient and improving customer experiences. The modular services portfolio Nokia is now rolling out will help CSPs with both of these objectives in a more targeted way.”
Brenda Stonestreet, Head of Technology Operations at Chorus New Zealand, said: “Nokia have provided consistent and expected operational performance outcomes, resulting in a stable end customer service delivery for Chorus customers. In parallel to this Nokia has established a focus on continuous operations improvement through a formal Service Improvement Plan program influencing field and customer assurance activities within Chorus’s scope.” 
Friedrich Trawoeger, Senior Vice President, Cloud and Cognitive Services at Nokia, said: “We know that customer expectations have changed so our focus with these new services is to help CSPs realize business outcomes leveraging the intelligence in their networks. The methodology can follow our customers’ unique digital transformation journey. In addition, the catalogue approach is another step in our strategy towards providing a complete Software as a service (SaaS) portfolio.”

Press Release
Nokia launches Intelligent RAN Operations to manage the power of 5G with machine learning #MWC22
Nokia’s Intelligent RAN Operations solution goes beyond automation with machine learning to help mobile operators keep costs down with superior 5G network management  
Reduces base station energy consumption by up to 15 percent without compromising end-user experience
Improves operational efficiency by up to 80 percent according to Nokia customer trials, boosting network quality
22 February 2022
Espoo, Finland – Nokia has today announced the launch of its new Intelligent RAN Operations solution designed to manage the increasing complexity of 5G networks through machine learning (ML). The framework and its underlying products enable mobile operators to boost 5G network quality, efficiency, and the subscriber experience while reducing operational costs, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions. The solution supports Nokia’s ambitious commitment to sustainability and combatting climate change.
Nokia Intelligent RAN Operations implements several machine learning functionalities that help operators manage network density and complexity. It enables the automation of routine network management tasks, with a greater ability to detect, categorize and solve network issues in real-time. This saves time and eliminates human error.
5G networks have ushered in a host of new use cases as well as products and services reliant on ultra-low latency and resiliency. They also support a vast range of applications with widely varying service requirements. In this complex environment, operating cost-effective radio networks using manual intensive tools or even just automation is no longer possible.
Operators trialing the solution on a live network have seen an operational efficiency gain of up to 80 percent with zero-touch optimization, and 70 percent fewer issues to resolve, reducing team workloads and helping ensure consistent network quality. The solution also includes intelligent energy-saving features that reduce base station power consumption by up to 15 percent, enabling more sustainable operating practices.
Nokia has set sustainability goals to reduce its environmental impact and help its customers to do the same. The company has committed to reducing its emissions by 50 percent across both its operations and products in use by 2030. Nokia’s technology is designed to be energy efficient, contributing towards the climate and environmental targets of mobile operators.
Nokia at Mobile World Congress 2022
Nokia is showcasing its Intelligent RAN Operations solution at Mobile World Congress 2022 in Barcelona, Hall 3 Stand 3A10. The demonstration shows how machine learning helps automate radio network energy-saving configuration and management while reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions.
James Crawshaw, Principal Analyst at Omdia, said: “As mobile networks have evolved from 2G through 5G they have become much more performant and sophisticated. Management and configuration tools largely kept pace with this evolution - until now. To optimize operational, capital, and energy efficiency in the 5G era requires a paradigm shift. Manual configuration of the thousands of parameters available in network nodes, a ten-fold increase on 4G, is no longer feasible. Operators need automated solutions that leverage artificial intelligence to augment and relieve human intelligence which can then be brought to bear on the manifold RAN operational challenges that computers are not yet able to solve.”

Press Release 
Nokia announces new Software-as-a-Service services in analytics, security, and monetization for CSPs and enterprises #MWC22
Nokia AVA Network Data Analytics Function, in a SaaS model, enhances network operations with AI/ML driven closed-loop automation and provides analytics at the network edge
iSIM Secure Connect through a SaaS delivery model manages machine-to-machine and consumer device subscriptions for eSIM- and iSIM-enabled devices
21 February 2022 
Espoo, Finland – Nokia today announced two new Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) services in the areas of security and analytics, as part of its strategy to give communication service providers (CSPs) and enterprises a more flexible and cost effective way for servicing their customers, and operating and monetizing their networks, as advanced 5G services are rolled out.
The new services follow Nokia’s recent launch into SaaS to help CSPs and enterprises accelerate the time to value they realize from their services offering by shifting to an agile model based on software consumed purely on demand through a subscription, and away from customized software run on costly, complex, on-premise infrastructure.
As opposed to classic SIMs, embedded SIM (eSIM) and integrated SIM (iSIM) technologies can store and manage multiple subscription profiles remotely for authenticating users and devices on mobile networks. iSIM Secure Connect gives control to automate the entire eSIM/iSIM management process and will open opportunities to monetize services linked to trusted digital identities.
Nokia’s iSIM Secure Connect, through a SaaS delivery model, enables CSPs and enterprises to securely manage machine-to-machine and consumer device subscriptions for eSIM- and iSIM-enabled devices.
As 5G network complexity has increased the need for advanced analytics, Nokia is strengthening its AVA offering with new SaaS capabilities based on NWDAF (Network Data Analytics Function), part of 5G Standalone architecture.
Nokia AVA NWDAF enhances network operations with AI/ML driven closed-loop automation, improves customer experience, and drives new sources of revenue.
With its distributed architecture and open APIs, AVA NWDAF helps CSPs provide analytics at the network edge; implement analytics services defined by 3GPP; and create partnerships with software developers.
AVA NWDAF will be commercially available in a SaaS delivery model later this quarter. Nokia’s iSIM Secure Connect is currently expected to be available as SaaS later this year, and will still be offered to customers in other deployment models. Nokia’s SaaS-based NetGuard Cybersecurity Dome and Nokia Anomaly Detection, both announced in November 2021, will be available later this quarter. NetGuard Cybersecurity Dome enables CSPs to assure 5G networks and monetize security tied with services like 5G slicing; while Nokia Anomaly Detection is a machine learning service aimed at finding and remediating network anomalies before they affect customers.
Nokia plans to introduce other new SaaS services in the areas of core, digital operations, monetization, and private wireless later this year and into 2023.
As its SaaS product roadmap evolves, Nokia expects to deliver essential capabilities through open-source application programming interfaces (APIs) that are operable across many hyperscale platforms. This will create a multi-vendor SaaS delivery framework that makes the most of Nokia’s partnerships with leading cloud providers and its ongoing investments in cloud-native software and other technologies.
Karl Whitelock, Research Vice President, Communications Service Provider Operations & Monetization at IDC, said: “To fully tap the wealth of opportunities that advanced 5G services offer, communication service providers and enterprises need new deployment models that enable faster service delivery to customers in a smarter, more cost-effective manner. Solution suppliers such as Nokia with its new Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) security and analytics services, are turning to SaaS as a means for helping the telecom space modernize and monetize investments faster.” 
Raghav Sahgal, President of Cloud and Network Services at Nokia, said: “Adopting Nokia AVA NWDAF and iSIM Secure Connect through the SaaS model will greatly improve the time-to-value that CSPs and enterprises can realize by having on-demand access to services. These latest Nokia SaaS services strengthen our leadership position in helping our customers change the very foundation of how our industry does business.”

Press Release
Nokia Bell Labs selected for ARPA-E funding to develop energy-efficient data center technologies
Increasing demand for AI algorithms will require even more power-hungry compute hardware, stressing energy and carbon budgets further
Novel solutions from Bell Labs will allow for growth while addressing data center cooling energy efficiency and related carbon footprint
17 February 2022         
Espoo, Finland – Nokia today announced Bell Labs was selected by the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) within the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for OPEN 2021 funding to develop a highly efficient thermal energy architecture that will deliver a significant reduction in data center cooling energy, as well as capturing the waste heat for heating and cooling applications.
ARPA-E advances high-potential, high-impact energy technologies that are too early for private-sector investment to awardees that are developing entirely new ways to generate, store, and use energy. ARPA-E projects have the potential to radically improve U.S. economic prosperity, national security, and environmental wellbeing.
The announcement represents an extension of Nokia’s broader efforts to accelerate digitalization to help the information and communication technology (ICT) industry reduce its environmental footprint and to support other industries in becoming more resource and material efficient.
The increasing rate of digitalization and automation is driving compute systems and 5G communication networks to grow at incredible rates. AI algorithms are needed to deliver the growing range of digital services but require even more power-hungry compute hardware. Accordingly, cooling energy requirements are projected to grow from the current average of 30-40% of total power consumption preventing wider deployment of these new services and compounding the climate crisis that faces our world. The goal of this Nokia Bell Labs research program is a dramatic reduction in compute cooling energy to 5% or less with the additional benefit of eliminating the need to consume precious water supplies.
With ARPA-E support, Nokia Bell Labs and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign along with associate partners, including Carrier Global Corporation, will work together to explore a highly efficient, resource-conserving thermal energy architecture that will simultaneously improve energy efficiency of high-power-compute-cooling and deliver high-quality thermal energy that can be used directly for heating and cooling applications. By pursuing a low-cost, low-energy two-phase cooling philosophy from chip to room scale, the proposed technology will rearchitect compute infrastructure to provide a valuable heat source in a way that is practical and cost-effective.
Peter Vetter, President of Bell Labs Core Research, said: “At Bell Labs, we find the technology limits and push beyond them to tackle the hard challenges. Working with ARPA-E and our partners, we will look at how we can allow for sustainable growth. Our goal is to play a positive role in tackling climate change in the U.S. by reducing and re-using the energy flowing through the compute and communications hardware that delivers the digital services we all increasingly rely on. By using resources in a more efficient way, we will be able to increase our use of AI in our networks without requiring more energy than we use today.”
Nokia has committed to decreasing its emissions by 50% between 2019 and 2030 across its value chain. The targets includes its own operations, products in use, logistics, and final assembly supplier factories. Bell Labs has a long history of projects focused on improving energy efficiency, including inventing the first practical silicon solar cell in 1954. With broad applications beyond data centers, the project with ARPA-E will allow Bell Labs to continue supporting the United States’ technological lead and sustainability goals by developing and deploying advanced energy and ICT technologies.

Press Release 
Nokia research finds CSPs have catching up to do to deliver on 5G monetization
A Nokia-commissioned survey of 100 communication service providers (CSPs) around the world found only 11% have sufficient Business Support Systems (BSS) in place for effective 5G monetization
About 70% of respondents say they are now considering deploying cloud-based monetization systems
17 February 2022 
Espoo, Finland – Nokia today announced new research showing that communication service providers (CSPs) are behind in having the right software solutions in place to help them monetize their 5G networks with new services and network management tools.
To generate returns beyond the traditional data plans of the 3G/4G era, CSPs and enterprises need to modernize their legacy monetization systems, with new service offerings and application development ecosystems. New monetization systems that enable operators to deliver new services, like slicing, faster and at scale are a critical enabler of helping CSPs and enterprises realize faster returns on their network investments.
But the Nokia-commissioned global survey of 100 CSPs around the world found that only 11% of respondents have sufficient Business Support Systems (BSS) in place to meet the needs of 5G-enabled business models. BSS are a critical patchwork of business applications, which includes monetization tools, that help CSPs manage their operations and supply chains through functions, such as billing and charging, and for delivering a solid customer experience.
An overwhelming number of survey respondents, at 98%, indicated they would have to alter their BSS in the coming years in order to put proper, up-to-date monetization tools in place.
The survey also found that nearly 70% of CSPs are now considering deploying cloud-based monetization solutions. In addition, two-thirds of respondents indicated they believe that real-time charging is essential for 5G monetization, in part because of its ability to help CSPs respond quickly to customer demands.
A cloud-native software architecture is key to achieving a 5G-ready monetization system, with many benefits that include limitless scalability, and an ideal platform for AI, analytics, and edge computing capabilities for ultra-low latency use cases.
More details on the research can be found here.
John Abraham, Principal Analyst at Analysys Mason, said: ""Most Service Providers are ill-prepared to effectively engage and monetize emerging 5G-enabled use cases and need to urgently transform their BSS. With Service Providers looking to get that ROI on 5G, now is the time for them to invest in flexible monetization systems especially as 5G brings to the forefront the importance of real-time charging capabilities. Given Nokia’s portfolio and expertise, they are well placed to support CSPs on this journey.""
Hamdy Farid, Senior Vice President, Business Applications at Nokia, said: “To unlock 5G revenues and move beyond the traditional data plan model, a major shift among CSPs is needed toward adaptable monetization systems that utilize cloud-native, scalable and flexible infrastructure and open APIs for easy integration and deployment; and I think this survey highlights the work still to be done.”

Press Release
Nokia chosen by 450connect to supply network technology for LTE450 critical infrastructure network in Germany
New LTE450 radio network provides digitization platform necessary for energy transition to decarbonization, and to further secure the energy supply
Nokia to manage supply and performance of all LTE components, including maintenance services, until 2040
14 February 2022
Espoo, Finland – Nokia today announced it has signed a contract with 450connect, a joint venture backed by German companies from the energy and water sectors, to build its nationwide LTE450 radio network. The deal will cover the supply of radio system technology for the 450 MHz network, including the central technology, radio stations, microwave radio links for the backhaul network, and power back-up systems. Nokia will manage the supply and performance of all LTE components, including maintenance services, until 2040. 
In March 2021, 450connect GmbH was awarded the 450 MHz frequencies until 2040 by the Federal Network Agency. With 450connect's new nationwide, highly-available and secure LTE450 radio network, operators of critical infrastructures will receive the platform they need to digitalize their infrastructure, implement the energy transition to decarbonization, and further secure the energy supply.
The Nokia LTE450 technology is ideally suited to achieve wide-area coverage and operate services such as voice and machine-to-machine communications (M2M) or Internet-of-Things applications for critical infrastructure. This industrial-grade private LTE / LTE-M solution is optimized for M2M applications and critical voice communications.
Carsten Ullrich, CEO of 450connect, says: ""In view of the major challenges involved in setting up the 450 MHz platform, we are pleased to have Nokia as a strong and capable partner at our side for the long-term, with whom we can meet the high technical requirements of our customers as operators of critical infrastructures."" 
Dirk Lewandowski, Vice President Central and East Europe, Nokia Enterprise, says: ""The task of digitalization of Germany’s critical infrastructure is of enormous strategic importance. Nokia can make an important contribution to securing this country’s energy supply with our industrial-grade 450 MHz private LTE network, especially considering the challenges posed by the energy transition to decarbonization and decentralization. We look forward to a trusting and close cooperation with 450connect on this long-term and important project for the Federal Republic of Germany."" 
Due to the high demand for highly available and resilient communications, both parties have agreed to a rapid implementation of the radio network. Initial end-to-end tests will take place in the field by mid-2022 to ensure performance for the upcoming rollout. Radio services will be offered in the first regions of Germany in 2023. The nationwide rollout will take place by 2025.
The Nokia solution includes geo-redundant LTE cores, RAN network, Nokia Wavence microwave radio backhaul, management solution and installation, commissioning, integration, training and support services. In addition, 20 years of lifecycle network management of this critical network will be provided by Nokia. 
About NokiaAt Nokia, we create technology that helps the world act together.
As a trusted partner for critical networks, we are committed to innovation and technology leadership across mobile, fixed and cloud networks. We create value with intellectual property and long-term research, led by the award-winning Nokia Bell Labs.

About 450connect450connect GmbH is currently building and will operate the fail-safe platform for the digitalisation of critical infrastructures in Germany. The Cologne-based company is thus creating a decisive prerequisite for the decarbonisation and resilience of our national economy. For this purpose 450connect recently received the exclusive assignment of the 450MHz spectrum until 2040. 450connect is backed by more than 70 utilities, including Alliander, E.ON, a consortium of regional energy companies and the Versorger-Allianz 450, which includes numerous public utilities, energy and water suppliers with the participation of the EnBW-subsidiary Netze BW.

Nokia launches first phase of share buyback program
Espoo, Finland – In line with the announcement on 3 February 2022, the Board of Directors of Nokia Corporation (""Nokia"" or the ""Company"") has today decided to launch the first phase of the share buyback program.
The main terms of the first phase of the share buyback program:
The aggregate purchase price of all Nokia shares to be acquired shall not exceed EUR 300 million. 
The repurchases will start at the earliest on 14 February 2022 and end by 22 December 2022.
The purpose of the repurchases is to optimize Nokia's capital structure through the reduction of capital. The repurchased shares will be cancelled accordingly. The repurchases will be funded using funds in the reserve for invested unrestricted equity and the repurchases will reduce total unrestricted equity.
The repurchases are based on the authorization granted by Nokia's Annual General Meeting on 8 April 2021. The maximum number of shares that can be repurchased under the first phase of the program is 275,000,000 shares corresponding to approximately 5 % of the total number of shares in Nokia.
The shares will be acquired through public trading on the regulated market of Nasdaq Helsinki and select multilateral trading facilities. No repurchases will be made in the United States. Nokia has appointed a third-party broker as the lead-manager for the first phase of the buyback program. The lead-manager will make trading decisions independently of and without influence from Nokia. The repurchases will be carried out in accordance with the so-called safe harbour rules referred to in Article 5 of the EU Market Abuse Regulation (EU N:o 596/2014).
The price payable per share shall be determined in public trading on the relevant trading venue at the time of the repurchase, in compliance with the price and volume limits applicable under the safe harbour rules. 
Nokia may terminate the program prior to its scheduled end date and will in such case issue a stock exchange release to this effect.

Nokia deploys IP peering solution to upgrade TREX regional internet exchanges in Finland 
Solution delivers higher speed internet connectivity in a small footprint
Enhances TREX’s network automation capabilities for current and future services 
Provides TREX with greater visibility and control of its network operations

9 February 2022
Espoo, Finland – Nokia today announced it will supply IP routing platforms to enable Finnish internet exchange provider TREX Regional Exchanges Oy (TREX) to scale its regional interconnection and peering infrastructure. The solution will enable TREX to deliver higher capacity services to customers while increasing operations efficiency through network automation. 
TREX will deploy the Nokia 7220 Interconnect Router platforms running on the Nokia SR Linux network operating system (NOS) to upgrade its network. The platforms, supplied by Nokia partner NetNordic, deliver high-density, high-speed IP routing in a small footprint that will allow TREX to increase its interconnection and peering services capacity.
Aleksi Suhonen, Chairman of TREX, said: “We chose the Nokia 7220 IXR platform running SR Linux because it meets our current and future requirements for a scalable, cost-effective interconnection platform with advanced network operations capabilities. The new platform will allow us to meet increasing customer traffic needs while ensuring operations efficiency through network automation.”
Manuel Ortiz Fernandez, Senior Vice President of EMEA Webscale business at Nokia, said: “TREX is expanding its regional interconnection capabilities to meet the needs of its customers as they embrace new digital and cloud technologies. We are pleased that TREX has chosen Nokia IP routing technology to enhance its interconnection capabilities to support the needs of its consumers in the region.”
The Nokia SR Linux provides TREX with an open and extensible NOS that allows the collection of operations data – such as fine-grained system state, configuration settings and real-time network analytics – using push-based streaming telemetry. TREX can enhance its automation capabilities for current and future network services by leveraging the extensive automation framework provided with the Nokia SR Linux.

Nokia delivers private wireless to bridge the digital divide for students’ homes in rural California
Nokia and partner AggreGateway design and deploy 4G fixed wireless access solution to enable underserved students in the Dos Palos-Oro Loma school district to access broadband internet services at home
Solution incorporates Nokia Digital Automation Cloud (DAC) Private 4.9G/LTE and Nokia FastMile Fixed Wireless Access
Two-phase deployment will serve the distance learning needs of 2400 students
	 
8 February 2022
Espoo, Finland – Nokia today announced it has completed the first of a two-phase deployment of 4G Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) technology, along with partner AggreGateway, to provide broadband internet connectivity to underserved students in the Dos Palos Oro Loma (DPOL) school district of California.
The district, located in the predominantly rural San Joaquin Valley in California, comprises five campuses and serves a population of 5,000 residents. The Nokia solution will provide secure, reliable, high-performance internet access to the homes of 2400 students using Nokia Private 4.9G/LTE Digital Automation Cloud (NDAC) operating in the CBRS/On-Go GAA spectrum, and customer premises equipment (CPE) including Nokia FastMile 4G Gateways and WiFi Beacons.
The DPOL technology team will operate its new LTE network through the centrally secure Nokia DAC Cloud monitoring application. DPOL will also provision LTE / Wi-Fi hotspots to students to be used with any standard laptop or tablet to access high-speed internet.
The Federal Communications Commission has reported nearly 17 million school children in the USA lack internet access at home, creating a nationwide ‘homework gap’ (Federal Communications Commission). This became even more pronounced during the pandemic as schools closed and distance learning became the new normal.
Paoze Lee, Technology Systems Director of the Dos Palos-Oro Loma school district,  said: “As we put a plan in place for distance learning during the pandemic we found we could only provide coverage for approximately 50% of DPOL students via commercial wireless network providers. Working with Nokia and AggreGateway, we are taking the next steps to level the field and ensure every student has the same access to our learning facilities.”
Octavio Navarro, President of AggreGateway, said: “Growing up in a rural small town like Dos Palos-Oro Loma, I experienced the digital divide firsthand. Being able to implement a Nokia private wireless solution for the students has been beyond rewarding. The IT staff from DPOL, AggreGateway, and Nokia worked seamlessly together to achieve this goal. We are excited, proud, and look forward to the continued success.”
Matt Young, Head of Enterprise for North America at Nokia, said: “We are pleased to help close the digital divide in the Dos Palos-Oro Loma school district. For many rural areas of the US it’s not commercially viable to build out networks, and often families on the lowest income suffer. Leveraging our DAC and FastMile FWA technologies we can enable the delivery of much needed internet connectivity to students in the area.”
The project’s first phase was completed in November 2021. Nokia and AggreGateway will complete the second phase in 2022.

The dividend and/or equity repayment based on the resolution of the Board of Directors will be paid to a shareholder registered in the Company’s shareholders’ register maintained by Euroclear Finland Ltd on the record date of the dividend and/or equity repayment.
Board composition and remuneration
Kari Stadigh, the Vice Chair of the Board, has informed that he will no longer be available to serve on the Nokia Board of Directors after the Annual General Meeting. The Board proposes, on the recommendation of the Board’s Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee, that the number of Board members be ten (10) and that the following current Board members be re-elected as members of the Nokia Board of Directors for a term ending at the close of the next Annual General Meeting: Sari Baldauf, Bruce Brown, Thomas Dannenfeldt, Jeanette Horan, Edward Kozel, Søren Skou and Carla Smits-Nusteling.
In addition, the Committee proposes that Lisa Hook, former President and Chief Executive Officer of Neustar, Inc., Thomas Saueressig, member of the Executive Board of SAP SE and Global Head of SAP Product Engineering, and Kai Öistämö, President and Chief Executive Officer of Vaisala Corporation, be elected as new members of the Board of Directors for a term until the close of the next Annual General Meeting.
Resumes of the Board candidates are presented in the Board’s proposal available on www.nokia.com/agm. 
The Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee will propose in the assembly meeting of the new Board of Directors on 5 April 2022 that Sari Baldauf be re-elected as Chair of the Board and Søren Skou as new Vice Chair of the Board, subject to their election to the Board of Directors.
To ensure the competitiveness of the Board remuneration and reflecting the fee development in Nokia’s global peer group, the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee has resolved to recommend to the Board that the annual fees of Board members, save for the Chair of the Board, would be proposed to be increased with EUR 10 000. Other remuneration payable to the Board members would remain unchanged. 
Consequently, on the recommendation of the Board’s Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee, and in line with the Company’s Remuneration Policy, the Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the annual fees payable for a term ending at the close of the next Annual General Meeting be as follows:
EUR 440 000 for the Chair of the Board;
EUR 195 000 for the Vice Chair of the Board; 
EUR 170 000 for each member of the Board;
EUR 30 000 each for the Chairs of the Audit Committee and the Personnel Committee and EUR 20 000 for the Chair of the Technology Committee as an additional annual fee; and
EUR 15 000 for each member of the Audit Committee and Personnel Committee and EUR 10 000 for each member of the Technology Committee as an additional annual fee.

The Board proposes that in line with the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, approximately 40% of the annual fee be paid in Nokia shares either purchased from the market on behalf of the Board members or alternatively delivered as treasury shares held by the Company as soon as practicable after the Annual General Meeting. The rest of the annual fee would be payable in cash to cover taxes arising from the remuneration. 
In addition, the Board of Directors proposes that the meeting fees for Board and Board Committee meetings payable to all the other Board members, except for the Chair of the Board, remain at current level. The meeting fees are based on potential travel required between the Board member’s home location and the location of a meeting and paid for a maximum of seven meetings per term as follows:
EUR 5 000 per meeting requiring intercontinental travel; and
EUR 2 000 per meeting requiring continental travel.
Only one meeting fee would be payable in the usual case of multiple Board and Board Committee meetings per eligible travel. Moreover, it is proposed that members of the Board of Directors shall be compensated for travel and accommodation expenses as well as other costs directly related to Board and Board Committee work. The meeting fees, travel expenses and other expenses would be paid in cash.
Auditor election and remuneration
Since 2019 the Board of Directors has proposed to the Annual General Meeting that the shareholders would elect the auditor for the financial year commencing next after the election. Therefore, on the recommendation of the Board’s Audit Committee, the Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that Deloitte Oy be re-elected as the auditor of the Company for the financial year 2023.
It is also proposed that the elected auditor for the financial year 2023 be reimbursed based on the invoice of the auditor and in compliance with the purchase policy approved by the Audit Committee.
Authorization to the Board to issue shares and repurchase company’s shares
In line with previous years, the Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorize the Board to resolve to issue in total a maximum of 550 million shares through issuance of shares or special rights entitling to shares under Chapter 10, Section 1 of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act in one or more issues during the effective period of the authorization. The Board may issue either new shares or treasury shares held by the Company. Shares and special rights entitling to shares may be issued in deviation from the shareholders’ pre-emptive rights within the limits set by law. The authorization may be used to develop the Company’s capital structure, diversify the shareholder base, finance or carry out acquisitions or other arrangements, to settle the Company’s equity-based incentive plans or for other purposes resolved by the Board. It is proposed that the authorization be effective until 4 October 2023 and terminate the authorization for issuance of shares and special rights entitling to shares resolved at the Annual General Meeting on 8 April 2021. 
Also, in line with previous years, the Board proposes that the Board be authorized to resolve to repurchase a maximum of 550 million shares. The repurchases would reduce distributable funds of the Company. The shares may be repurchased otherwise than in proportion to the shares held by the shareholders (directed repurchase). Shares may be repurchased to be cancelled, held to be reissued, transferred further or for other purposes resolved by the Board. It is proposed that the authorization be effective until 4 October 2023 and terminate the authorization for repurchasing the Company’s shares granted by the Annual General Meeting on 8 April 2021 to the extent that the Board has not previously resolved to repurchase shares based on such authorization.
550 million shares correspond to less than 10 percent of the Company’s total number of shares. The Board shall resolve on all other matters related to the issuance or repurchase of Nokia shares in accordance with the resolution by the Annual General Meeting.
Other matters to be addressed by the Annual General Meeting 
Furthermore, the Annual General Meeting would also address adopting the Company’s financial statements for the financial year 2021, discharging the members of the Board of Directors and the President and Chief Executive Officer from liability for the financial year 2021 and adopting, in an advisory vote, the Remuneration Report for the Company’s governing bodies. 
The Remuneration Report for 2021 as well as the “Nokia in 2021” annual report, which includes the Company’s Annual Accounts, the review by the Board of Directors and the auditor’s report, are expected to be published and available on www.nokia.com/agm in week 9 of 2022. The Remuneration Report for 2021 will be published by a stock exchange release as well.

Nokia Corporation Financial Report for Q4 and full year 2021
Solid end to a transformational year
2021 was a transformational year for Nokia, including refocusing on and strengthening our technology leadership. 
In Q4, Nokia’s underlying business performed largely as expected with other operating income being above expectations.
Q4 net sales declined 5% y-o-y in constant currency as expected with strong growth in Network Infrastructure of +10% offset by Mobile Networks at -16%. Full year net sales grew 3% y-o-y in constant currency.
Comparable operating margin of 14.2% (reported 11.5%) in Q4 declined 190bps y-o-y (reported +480bps) due to lower Q4 seasonality as expected. 
Full year comparable operating margin of 12.5% (reported 9.7%) expanded 300bps y-o-y (reported +570bps) but also benefited from approximately 150bps of one-offs. 
Comparable diluted EPS of EUR 0.13 in Q4; reported diluted EPS of EUR 0.12.
Continued strong free cash flow generation of EUR 0.4bn in Q4. Full year free cash flow of EUR 2.4bn.
Guidance for 2022 net sales of EUR 22.6-23.8bn and a comparable operating margin in the range 11-13.5%.
New long-term targets to grow revenue faster than the market and a comparable operating margin of ≥14%. 
Board proposes dividend authorization of EUR 0.08 per share. Share buyback program to be initiated to return EUR 600m over 2 years. 
This is a summary of the Nokia Corporation financial report for Q4 and full year 2021 published today. Nokia only publishes a summary of its financial reports in stock exchange releases. The summary focuses on Nokia Group's financial information as well as on Nokia's outlook. The detailed, segment-level discussion will be available in the complete financial report hosted at www.nokia.com/financials. A video interview summarizing the key points of our Q4 results will also be published on the website. Investors should not solely rely on summaries of Nokia's financial reports and should also review the complete report with tables.
PEKKA LUNDMARK, PRESIDENT AND CEO, ON Q4 AND FULL YEAR 2021 RESULTS
2021 was a strong year for Nokia driven by our growing technology leadership, robust demand and a faster than expected reset of our business. This enabled us to deliver 3% constant currency net sales growth and a comparable operating margin of 12.5%. Thanks to a solid Q4 capping off a strong 2021, we have created an excellent foundation as we begin to move into the next phase of our strategy to deliver growth and expand profitability. 
All our business groups made significant progress this year to make us more competitive in all the markets in which we compete. Mobile Networks largely closed the gap to competition in 5G and improved its gross margin while continuing to step up R&D investments. Network Infrastructure extended its technology leadership with significant growth driven by Fixed Networks and Submarine Networks. Cloud and Network Services continued to rebalance its portfolio and saw encouraging growth in its key focus areas. Nokia Technologies made good progress expanding in areas such as automotive and consumer electronics. 
The progress we have made with cash generation in the business has strengthened our balance sheet to the point we can look to reinstate shareholder distributions through both a dividend and share buyback program. 
Nokia enters 2022 in a strong position with improved margins, faster than expected strategy execution and a high order backlog, although the global supply chain situation remains tight. We see opportunities in the 5G roll out and growing enterprise market. Accordingly, we expect 2022 to bring another year of sales growth and we are targeting a comparable operating margin of 11-13.5% in 2022. 
Considering how quickly we have executed on our strategy, we are now introducing new long-term targets. We still expect to deliver progress in 2023 but we want to emphasize that is not the end of our ambition. Our long-term target is to grow faster than the market and to achieve a comparable operating margin of at least 14%. The pace of delivery will depend on both the market environment and decisions we may make on R&D investments to secure our long-term competitiveness and sustainable profitability. 
Finally, I want to thank our employees whose excellence, resilience and adaptability have been critical in delivering this performance in 2021. We recognise how valuable each person is to Nokia’s performance and we will increase investment in our people through our renewed people strategy.

SHAREHOLDER DISTRIBUTION
Dividend policy and 2021 proposal
In line with Nokia’s dividend policy as stated below, Nokia’s Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board to resolve on a dividend of EUR 0.08 per share be paid to investors in respect of financial year 2021. If the resolution is approved the dividend would be paid in quarterly installments starting after the AGM. 
Our dividend policy is to target recurring, stable and over time growing ordinary dividend payments, taking into account the previous year’s earnings as well as the company’s financial position and business outlook.
Share buyback program
In 2020 and 2021, Nokia has generated strong cash flow which has significantly improved the cash position of the company. To manage the company’s capital structure, Nokia’s Board of Directors is initiating a share buyback program under the current authorization from the AGM to repurchase shares, with purchases expected to begin in Q1. The program targets to return up to EUR 600m of cash to shareholders in tranches over a period of two years, subject to continued authorization from the AGM.

1 Assuming the rate 1 EUR = 1.13 USD as of 31 Dec 2021 continues throughout 2022.2  Please refer to Note 10, Performance measures, in the Financial statement information section included in Nokia Corporation Financial Report for Q4 and full year 2021 for a full explanation of how these terms are defined. 
OUTLOOK ASSUMPTIONS
The outlook, the long-term targets (3-5 years) and all of the underlying outlook assumptions described below are subject to risk factors as described in the Risk Factors section later in this release. All of the below outlook assumptions are new as they now refer to 2022 and over the longer-term.
Nokia’s outlook assumptions for the comparable operating margin of each business group in 2022 are provided below:
     
  Full year 2022  
  Mobile Networks  
  6.5 to 9.5%  
  Network Infrastructure  
  9.5 to 12.5%  
  Cloud and Network Services  
  4.0 to 7.0%  
  Nokia Technologies  
  >75%  
We expect Nokia Technologies to deliver a largely stable operating profit performance in 2022 and over the longer-term;
We expect the net negative impact of Group Common and Other to be EUR 250 million in 2022 and over the longer-term;
In full year 2022, Nokia expects the free cash flow performance of Nokia Technologies to be approximately EUR 450 million lower than its operating profit, primarily due to prepayments we received from certain licensees in previous years;
Comparable financial income and expenses are expected to be an expense of approximately EUR 150-200 million in full year 2022 and over the longer-term;
Comparable income tax expenses are expected to be approximately EUR 450 million in full year 2022 and over the longer-term;
Cash outflows related to income taxes are expected to be approximately EUR 400 million in full year 2022 and over the longer-term;
Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately EUR 650 million in full year 2022 and around EUR 600 million over the longer-term; and
Rule of thumb related to currency fluctuations: Assuming our current mix of net sales and total costs (refer to Note 1, Basis of Preparation, in the Financial statement information section included in Nokia Corporation Financial Report for Q4 and full year 2021 for details), we expect that a 10% increase in the EUR/USD exchange rate would have an impact of approximately negative 4 to 5% on net sales and an approximately neutral impact on operating profit.

LONG-TERM TARGETS
With Nokia’s new 2022 guidance for comparable operating margin exceeding the prior 2023 outlook for comparable operating margin and to better reflect long-term ambitions, Nokia has replaced its prior 2023 outlook with long-term targets (3-5 years) for the business, as laid out below. These new targets are intended to show Nokia’s plan to deliver continuous improvement over time in the business.
  Net sales  
  Grow faster than the market  
  Comparable operating margin  
  ≥14%  
  Free cash flow  
  55-85% conversion from comparable operating profit  
RISK FACTORS

Through the 2015 Paris Agreement, world governments committed to limiting global temperature rise to well-below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C. In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that global warming must not exceed 1.5°C above pre-industrial temperatures to avoid the catastrophic impacts of climate change. To achieve this, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions must halve by 2030 – and drop to net zero by 2050.
Understanding scope 1, 2 and emissions
Scope 1. Direct emissions, from sources owned or controlled by the company
Scope 2. Indirect emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity, heat, and/or steam
Scope 3. Indirect emissions as a consequence of the activities of the company but from sources not owned or controlled by the company

AI-based solution improves the safety of railroad crossings with real-time monitoring, using machine learning algorithms to continually increase accuracy and response, improving operational and cost efficiencies.
12 January 2022
Espoo, Finland – Nokia today announced the deployment of its Scene Analytics solution for Baselland Transport AG (BLT) in Münchenstein, Switzerland. The AI-based system applies computer vision and machine learning technologies for real-time monitoring and analysis, to ensure the safety of railroad crossings. As the first deployment of this kind in Europe, Nokia’s collaboration with Schweizer Electronics and BLT demonstrated the reliability of AI-based railroad safety solutions for daily use.
Safety of passengers and vehicles at level crossings remains a concern for rail authorities due to the threat of serious injury or loss of life in these areas. Statistics from the European Union identified around 250 fatalities and 300 serious injuries related to level crossings in the EU-28 countries in 2018[1]. Even the best warning systems can be bypassed, and crossings obstructed, making it essential for train operators to be alerted of issues in real-time.
Integrating Nokia Scene Analytics, BLT can use machine learning algorithms based on CCTV data to continually learn what is “normal” or anomalous. In addition to reporting anomalies to railway security in real-time, the AI-based platform detects the object type, which provides a more complete picture of the situation at hand. Event based video clips, images and associated data are stored, enabling post-incident forensic analysis.
 
Besides improving safety and response time, the deployment of Scene Analytics on railroad crossings also increases operational efficiencies by minimizing downtime and delays. Its machine learning capability reduces the time investment required by rail personnel to manually update the system. In doing so, Nokia Scene Analytics provides train operators with much greater overall cost efficiency. It can also be integrated with many standard industry cameras, reducing the total cost of ownership, and increasing the return on investment.
Michael Theiler, Head of Maintenance Electrical Systems at BLT, said: “Level crossings are notoriously difficult areas to ensure the safety of passengers, pedestrians, train operators and motorists. This deployment, in collaboration with Nokia represents an encouraging step towards using analytics as another layer of protection in dangerous areas. Nokia Scene Analytics acts as an intelligent set of ‘eyes’ and, by providing critical information in real-time, to prevent or mitigate the impact of an incident”.
Roland Liem, Head of Product Unit Railroad Safety at Schweizer Electronics, said: “By combining level crossing systems and Scene Analytics within a simple interface, this project with Nokia and BLT enabled us to automate the interaction between level crossing systems and alarms for enhanced safety. This will enable rail operators to close barriers and respond to dangerous situations at crossings in real-time.”
 
Karsten Oberle, Head of Rail at Nokia, said: “As the first deployment of its kind in Europe, this project with Schweizer Electronics and BLT enabled us to address many of the level crossing safety issues which are at the top of priority lists for rail operators. It is now our ambition for Nokia Scene Analytics to become a key part of the transition towards the digitalization of future railways. By integrating machine learning into level crossing systems, we will be able to continuously improve and refine safety processes in real-time. This will ensure that safety remains at the forefront for train operators, workers and customers alike.”

Nokia expects to exceed 2021 financial guidance and provides operating margin guidance for 2022
Espoo, Finland – Nokia is today providing an update to its financial guidance for 2021 and a comparable operating margin guidance for 2022.
In Q4 2021 Nokia’s underlying business performed largely as expected. However, other operating income was higher than expected including further benefits from venture fund investments, leading to a stronger comparable operating margin exceeding the 2021 guidance. 
Based on preliminary and unaudited financial results for 2021 Nokia now estimates net sales of approximately €22.2bn within its previous guidance of €21.7 to 22.7bn and a comparable operating margin of 12.4 to 12.6% above its previous guidance of 10 to 12%. The company estimates it has benefited from approximately 150bps of one-offs in financial year 2021 to its comparable operating margin (up from 100bps expected at our Q3 earnings) related to venture fund investments, a one-off software contract in Q2, bad debt provision reversals and some other one-time benefits.

2022 outlook:
Nokia is also introducing a new comparable operating margin guidance for financial year 2022 of 11% to 13.5%. This new guidance considers estimated continued improvements in the underlying business, supply constraints and cost inflation, with the year-on-year progression also impacted by the significant one-offs seen in 2021. 
The company will release its fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results on Thursday 3 February 2022 when it will also revisit its longer-term outlook. 
Nokia will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its fourth quarter performance and business outlook on 3 February 2022 at 11:30am EET / 9:30am BST / 4:30am US EST.
