       "  'Press Release\\nNokia demonstrates live D-Band microwave backhaul connection\\nD-Band will be a valuable resource for ultra-high-capacity backhaul connectivity in dense urban environments\\n13 April 2022\\nEspoo, Finland – Nokia today announced that it has successfully demonstrated a live microwave connection utilizing D-Band spectrum (130-175 GHz). D-Band enables much higher bandwidth than other microwave bands and will serve as an ultra-high-capacity extension for 5G backhaul and fronthaul in dense urban environments. The trial, which was conducted by Nokia utilizing Nokia Bell Labs technology, is investigating how higher frequencies beyond 100 GHz, can support the increased capacity requirements of mobile networks.   \\nThe proliferation of 5G networks has seen increasing demand for high-capacity, high-speed microwave backhaul to support evolving network requirements and growing traffic. This requires the use of higher frequency bands previously not used for this purpose. These bands can support large channel bandwidths and handle up to 50 times more traffic than microwave bands typically used for mobile network backhaul. D-Band is expected to be mostly used in dense urban environments, thanks to the small form factors of the products involved.\\nThe trial used an integrated dual-transceiver using a 2 GHz channel bandwidth operating over a distance of approximately 200 meters; this solution was developed by Nokia Bell Labs.\\nGiuseppe Targia, Vice President, Microwave Radio Links at Nokia said: “This trial demonstrates how we are continuing to push the boundaries to deliver best-in-class connectivity as the demand for 5G services grows. The D-Band will be important in delivering high-capacity 5G connectivity in the future. We continue to drive important innovations that support our customers with coverage and capacity where it is needed.”\\nResources\\nMicrowave Anyhaul\\nAbout Nokia\\nAt Nokia, we create technology that helps the world act together.\\nAs a trusted partner for critical networks, we are committed to innovation and technology leadership across mobile, fixed and cloud networks.

       "  \"Nokia Corporation\\nStock Exchange Release\\n12 April 2022 at 09:00 EEST\\nNokia to exit the Russian market, no impact to financial outlook\\nEspoo, Finland – It has been clear for Nokia since the early days of the invasion of Ukraine that continuing our presence in Russia would not be possible. Over the last weeks we have suspended deliveries, stopped new business and are moving our limited R&D activities out of Russia. We can now announce we will exit the Russian market. During this process our priority continues to be the safety and wellbeing of our employees.\\nFor humanitarian reasons, Western governments have expressed concerns about the risk of critical telecommunication network infrastructure in Russia failing. They have also emphasized the importance of ensuring the continued flow of information and access to the internet which provides outside perspectives to the Russian people. Therefore, as we exit we will aim to provide the necessary support to maintain the networks and are applying for the relevant licenses to enable this support in compliance with current sanctions.\\nThis is the most responsible course of action for Nokia to take as we exit the Russian market.\\nRegarding the financial impact of the decision, Russia accounted for less than 2% of our net sales in 2021. Considering the strong demand we see in other regions – we do not expect this decision to impact our ability to achieve our 2022 outlook provided in the Nokia financial report for Q4 and full year 2021 issued on 3 February 2022. We expect this decision to lead to a provision in Q1 of approximately €100m which will impact our reported but not comparable financials.\\nAbout Nokia\\nAt Nokia, we create technology that helps the world act together.\\nAs a trusted partner for critical networks, we are committed to innovation and technology leadership across mobile, fixed and cloud networks.
